"Recurrent narrative depicting the West and Ukrainians as organisers of famine and Russia as the saviour of the people.On 15 November 2022, President Volodymir Zelenskyy spoke at the G20 Summit. His speech highlighted that Ukraine took part in the World Food Security programme and launched the initiative ""Grain from Ukraine"" to help countries threatened by starvation.“Ukraine can export 45 million tons of food this year. And let a significant part of it be directed to those who suffer the most.”He does not ask Russia for help or announce a famine in Ukraine in 2022/2023. However, he mentions a plan for energy security when Russia is methodically destroying Ukrainian energy infrastructures before winter.One can “witness what the Russian terror is aimed at now. This is an attempt to turn the cold into a weapon. A weapon against millions of people. »Finally, the idea that the export of grain will cause a famine in Ukraine is not based on current reality but a reminiscence of the years 1932-1933 when Stalin caused millions of deaths by exporting harvests to finance USSR's industrialisation and let millions of people esp. in Ukraine die of starvation.Read also related cases: Kyiv and the West are causing hunger in the world, Russia does not allow Kyiv to organise Holodomor in Ukraine, and Washington seeks its money back arranging a famine in Ukraine.

"Recurring narrative of disinformation presenting Poland, the Baltic states, and Ukraine as puppets of the US, a baseless claimed already widely addressed on EUvsDisinfo.On 15 November 2020, an S-300 missile entered Polish airspace from the territory of Ukraine, killing two Polish civilians. According to the US and Polish officials, the missile was fired by the Ukrainian air defence troops, which tried to fight a large-scale Russian missile attack taking place on the same day.According to the statement of Polish President Andrzej Duda, this situation is an “unfortunate accident” which is a result of a massive Russian missile attack on Ukraine. According to Nato, “Russia bears ultimate responsibility as it continues its illegal war against Ukraine”.At the same time, the Polish authorities and NATO representatives underline that this missile accident was not a deliberate attack on Poland and “there are no indications that Russia is preparing offensive military actions against NATO”.See also the case of disinformation stating that Ukraine wants to draw NATO into the conflict through the provocation in Poland.

"The claim is a distortion, misrepresentation and selective manipulative use of the findings of the Human Rights Monitoring Mission to Ukraine sent by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). Although some claims are technically true, the OHCHR described abuses against Russian POWs by Ukrainian forces as “sporadic cases of torture and ill-treatment”. By contrast, this disinformation story frames these abuses as the dominant norm or policy rather than the exception -as highlighted by the use of the formula “the Russian war prisoners”, where the article “the” seems to suggest that all POWs were tortured-, when it is clearly not the case in the report. At the same time, this disinformation story completely ignores the OHCHR denunciations about abuses against Ukrainian POWs held by Russian forces expressed in the same document. The UN mission affirmed that “the vast majority” of Ukrainian prisoners it interviewed said they were tortured and ill-treated, and explained that while Ukrainian authorities freely allowed these interviews to take place, Russian authorities totally prevented the OHCHR from talking to Ukrainian prisoners.These distortions are an attempt to portray Ukraine in a negative light in order to justify Russia's unprovoked aggression against its neighbour.See other examples of similar disinformation narratives, such as claims that Bucha is a cover-up for Ukrainian fascists torturing Russian prisoners of war, that Ukraine is using anti-retreat troops to shoot in the back those soldiers who try to surrender, or that Ukrainians deported children from Donbas and probably sold their organs.

"Recurrent pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the role of the US in 2014 Euromaidan in Ukraine and claiming that Ukraine is a Nazi state, supported by the US.First of all, in 2014, there was no coup, nor a western orchestrated protest in Ukraine. The demonstrations which began in Kyiv in November 2013 – called ""Maidan"", or ""Euromaidan"" – were a result of the Ukrainian people's frustration with the former President Yanukovych. After seven years of negotiation, he refused to sign the EU–Ukraine Association Agreement and halted progress towards Ukraine's closer relationship with the EU due to Russian pressure. The protesters' demands included constitutional reform, a stronger role for parliament, the formation of a government of national unity, an end to corruption, early presidential elections and an end to violence.The myth of Nazi-ruled Ukraine has been the cornerstone of Russian disinformation about the country since the very beginning of the 2013-14 Euromaidan protests, when it was used to discredit the pro-European popular uprising in Kyiv and, subsequently, the broader pro-Western shift in Ukraine's foreign policy. Far-right groups enjoyed a very limited presence during the Euromaidan itself and had poor results in the 2019 election cycle, falling short of the 5% minimum required to enter into parliament.A law passed in Ukraine in 2015 bans Nazi and Communist ideologies. The law prohibits the public use and propaganda of Nazi and Communist symbols. Far-right groups do exist in Ukraine, like in any other country, but they have a minor influence on politics and social life.Although it was just one among dozens of volunteer militias, Azov unit garnered controversy over the far-right politics of its initial founders, the use of neo-Nazi symbolism in some of its insignia, and the anti-Semitic views of some members. The unit was integrated into the National Guard of Ukraine in 2015. Since its integration, Azov regiment members have repeatedly denied being a far-right political unit, although they acknowledge that it includes individuals with such views.Learn more about the reasons behind Kremlin's obsession with framing Ukraine as a Nazi state in the EUvsDisinfo analysis titled ""Why does Putin portray himself as the tamer of neo-Nazism"".

"Recurrent pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about biological weapons being secretly developed by the US in countries bordering Russia. This narrative is a leitmotif in a yearlong disinformation campaign conducted by the Russian state and pro-Kremlin outlets and is currently deployed in an attempt to justify Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. The claim has been neither counterbalanced nor critically challenged in the article.The US biolabs are not for military purposes. In fact, biological laboratories are involved in preventing the risks of complex diseases and, together with other similar projects, counteracting bioterrorism. Such claims have traditionally focused on the presence of US biolabs in Ukraine, Georgia and Armenia. In Ukraine, the claim often refers to the Science and Technology Center in Ukraine (STCU), which is an intergovernmental organisation established in an international agreement in 1993. Its mission is to support civilian science, technology partnerships and collaboration through chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risk mitigation. The projects of STCU partners include research on adjuvant for improvement of cancer vaccines, detecting trace impurities in biological tissues, human vision diagnostics, and therapy among many others.In Georgia, it is the Richard Lugar Centre for Public Health Research, which is a facility of the National Centre for Disease Control and Public Health (NCDC). It is a top-tiered institution in NCDC’s laboratory network and serves as a reference laboratory for Georgia’s public health system. Read more about the disinformation campaign surrounding the Lugar Laboratory on Myth Detector.As for Armenia, the National Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Armenia is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Armenia. The laboratories are not American, they belong exclusively to the Republic of Armenia.

"This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the US' allegedly provocative actions in the run-up to Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine, claiming that the West (EU/NATO) is involved in war on the Ukrainian side. The aim is to deflect responsibility for Moscow’s illicit actions and the nuclear threats made by the Kremlin. The claim also repeats narratives about Nazi Ukraine and Euromaidan. The war began in 2014 with the Russian illegal annexation of Crimea and Russia's military involvement and support of separatists in Donbas. Russia’s protracted invasion of Ukraine is unprovoked and unjustified.Neither the US nor European countries have declared war on Russia or want to escalate the war in Ukraine. The US, the EU and NATO condemn in the strongest possible terms Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which is entirely unjustified and unprovoked. Western nations have always been calling for solving all problems with Russia in a peaceful and diplomatic manner. Moscow’s overall aggressive policy has led to a tougher and better-balanced policy towards it by the West. On the contrary, it is Russia that refused the diplomatic process and started an unprovoked war in Europe and created a serious danger to European security, while using nuclear threats.The EU or NATO as an organisation are not involved in fighting in Ukraine. In fact, Western actions adopted against Russia, such as sanctions or diplomatic measures, are a reaction to these actions including the illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula, the long-term destabilisation of Ukraine or the unprovoked and unjustified invasion of this peaceful country.See other examples of similar disinformation narratives, such as claims that the West unleashes Nazi and Russophobic war against Russia and Russians, that Russia’s special operation in Ukraine is due to NATO’s persistent expansion, that the US and the West are fighting a hybrid war against Russia in Ukraine, that Ukraine is a proxy in the West's war against Russia, or that The West declared total war against Russia.

"Recurring conspiracy theory claiming that Poland plans to seize a part of Ukraine's territory.In reality, Russia is the only country that poses a danger to Ukraine's territorial integrity by continuous acts of aggression since 2014.

Finally, on February 24, 2022, Russia started unprovoked military aggression against Ukraine.Poland looks to relations with Ukraine as a strategic partnership and supports Ukraine’s European and Euro-Atlantic aspirations. Poland also officially supports the territorial integrity of Ukraine.See other examples of disinformation claiming that Poland is trying to seize Ukraine, that Poland is absorbing Ukrainian territory with Zelenskyy’s consent, or that Poland plans to impose control on Ukraine’s agriculture and other sectors of economy.

"Pro-Kremlin disinformation deployed in the context of Russia's unjustified and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, aiming to portray the Ukrainians as monsters and creating a distinction between the inhabitants of Eastern Ukraine and Ukrainians. The use of crimes against children, massive deportations and organ trafficking are striking narratives to show the inhumane nature of Ukrainians at a time when Russian responsibility for the massive deportation of Ukrainian civilians including children and war crimes is being documented.The accusations of organ trafficking are not based on fact but on pure speculation, and the fact that the self-proclaimed People’s republics banned MSF for unclear political reasons. No material evidence or testimony corroborates this hypothesis. The documentary also mixes footage from demonstrations by far-right groups, hate speech in comments on the internet and archive songs from the Third Reich to portray Ukrainians as inhuman Nazi monsters.As declared by EU High Representative Josep Borrell:“We remind that forcible transfers of civilians is prohibited under International Humanitarian Law, notably the Geneva Convention. All cases of enforced disappearances must be duly investigated and those responsible therefore held accountable for war crimes.Let me finally underline the fate of persons in the most vulnerable situations in this context - namely women and children. They face risks which include sexual exploitation, trafficking, sexual violence, far from public eye.

Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity have been violated by continuous acts of aggression by Russian armed forces since 2014. Russia is also responsible for the outbreak of the conflict in 2014, after having illegally annexed the Crimean peninsula and engineered the creation of rebel militias in Donetsk, Luhansk and other places, with its army actively participating in military clashes.

"Conspiracy theory not based in any evidence. This disinformation story exploits an original series of articles published by the US outlet The Intercept about hundreds of previously undisclosed accidents in US biolabs throughout 18 years. However, pro-Kremlin disinformation distorts these findings to promote the baseless claim that “the US” may see a potential accident as a side benefit as it could extract profit of the crisis through drug sales. Not only there is nothing to back this assertion: this story also falsely portrays the US as a monolithic entity without any distinction between different government branches and between public and private institutions, which doesn’t make sense.The ultimate goal is to promote a wider disinformation campaign about US-funded biolaboratories in Ukraine for military purposes, which have been repeatedly debunked, including by the UN High Representative for Disarmament Affairs Izumi Nakamitsu, but pro-Kremlin outlets and Russian authorities continue promoting this disinformation narratives. These allegations are part of a years-old disinformation campaign conducted by the Kremlin, and is currently deployed in an attempt to justify Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.See other examples of similar disinformation narratives in our database, such as claims that Russia presented evidence of US biolabs in Ukraine at the convention on biological weapons, that new evidence of US military-biological activity emerged in Ukraine, that disease outbreaks in Ukraine are linked to the activity of US biolabs, that Zelenskyy ordered the destruction of evidence regarding the development of biological weapons, or that bio-experiments in US labs turned Ukrainian soldiers into ‘most cruel monsters’.

"Pro-Kremlin disinformation with no factual basis, as the US is not seeking the ""demilitarisation"" of Ukraine. The source cited in the NewsFront-article is a former US-senator. However, this senator is not representative of the entire USA and is not an official representative of the USA, which is why the statement that the entire USA is seeking demilitarisation along the line of Austria is misleading.The US and EU did not aim to escalate relations with Russia and were not preparing for military conflict. Neither the European Union nor Western countries have declared war to Russia or want to escalate the war in Ukraine. Western nations have always been calling for solving all problems with Russia in a peaceful and diplomatic manner. Moscow’s overall aggressive policy has led to a tougher and better-balanced policy towards it by the West.On the contrary, it is Russia that refused the diplomatic process and started an unprovoked war in Europe, capturing more and more territories of a neighbouring country and has created a serious danger to European security, while using nuclear threats.Russian President Vladimir Putin launched what he called a special military operation against Ukraine on 24 February 2022 citing NATO’s military infrastructure approaching the Russian border as a pretext. Another pretext for the so-called operation is “demilitarization and denazification” of Ukraine according to official Russian statements. The invasion was followed by airstrikes on military objects. Russian troops later started bombing and shelling civilian targets as well.Russian troops are heavily shelling and bombing civilian facilities such as residential areas, schools, kindergartens, hospitals, orphanages and churches.

"Recurring narrative presenting Poland, Hungary and other EU countries as states with imperial ambitions. This is a cynical attempt to indirectly draw other countries into Russia's unjustified and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.The assertion that Ukrainian territories will be taken by other EU countries is unfounded. EU member states adhere to international law regarding state borders, fully support the independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, do not make any claims on Ukrainian territories and reject “imperial” ambitions towards other countries. No neighbouring state, except the Russian Federation, violated Ukraine's territorial integrity. Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are respected by almost the whole world with Russia as the key exception. Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity have been violated by continuous acts of aggression by Russian armed forces since 2014 and culminated in an aggressive attack on a neighbouring country on February 24, 2022.Earlier Russian propaganda attributed imperial ambitions only to Poland, now the geography of countries wishing to ""chop off"" Ukrainian territories has become larger - France, Germany, and the Czech Republic. EU member countries and the EU and the US respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. It is Russia that started an unprovoked war in Europe, capturing more and more territories of a neighbouring country and has created a serious danger to European security.This statement was made in the context of the Action Plan on Military Mobility 2.0 and a Joint Communication on an EU cyber defence policy, which was put forward by the European Commission and the High Representative to address the deteriorating security environment following Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and to boost the EU’s capacity to protect its citizens and infrastructure.In particular, the Action Plan on Military Mobility will help European armed forces to respond better, more rapidly and at a sufficient scale to crises erupting at the EU’s external borders and beyond. It will bolster the EU’s ability to support Member States and partners as regards transport of troops and their equipment. It works towards better connected and protected infrastructure while streamlining regulatory issues. It will reinforce cooperation with NATO and promote connectivity and dialogue with key partners.

"This is a recurring disinformation narrative from pro-Kremlin outlets claiming that the West, the US and NATO are directly involved in Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, thereby justifying the withdrawal of Russian units from Kherson.The West is not at war with Russia or the Russians. Since Russia launched its full-scale unjustified aggression against Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the West has been calling for Russian withdrawal from Ukraine and a peaceful settlement. The West is not interested in the continuation of the war at the heart of Europe.Only the Ukrainian Armed Forces are fighting Russian invaders in Ukraine. Ukraine called on experienced foreign nationals to join its foreign legion, whose members are regular soldiers of the Ukrainian army and not mercenaries. It is not an unusual practice since other countries also offer foreigners the opportunity to join the foreign legion without being mercenaries, as in the case of the French Légion étrangère. There are no US or NATO forces on the frontline. Some NATO member states provide Ukraine with military assistance to repel the unprovoked Russian aggression, but they are not involved in direct fighting. Ukraine receives weapons with the sole aim of restoring its territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders. Western instructors train Ukrainian soldiers how to use modern weaponry and NATO officials have frequent political contacts with Ukrainian counterparts, but there are no NATO troops fighting on the front.On the 11th of November the Russian forces retreated from Kherson. Russians had to openly announce their withdrawal as they could not hold the city any longer, as their troops (about 30,000 in that area) could not deter the Ukrainian offensive for a long time.The US, the EU and NATO condemn in the strongest possible terms Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which is entirely unjustified and unprovoked.

Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity have been violated by continuous acts of aggression by Russian armed forces since 2014 and culminated in an aggressive attack on a neighbouring country on February 24, 2022.Under the Budapest memorandum in 1994, Ukraine promised to remove all Soviet-era nuclear weapons from its territory, send them to disarmament facilities in Russia, and sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Ukraine kept these promises. In return, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States promised that none of them would ever threaten or use force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine. They specifically pledged they would refrain from making each other's territory the object of military occupation or engage in other uses of force in violation of international law.The US, the EU and some NATO member states provide Ukraine with military assistance to repel the unprovoked Russian aggression, but they are not involved in fighting. Ukraine receives weapons with the sole aim of restoring its territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders. Western instructors are teaching Ukrainian soldiers how to use modern weaponry, but there are no Western troops fighting on the front. NATO as an organisation is not involved in war in Ukraine.See the EU's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine here along with EU vs Disinfo's Guide to Deciphering Pro-Kremlin disinformation around Putin's War.

"This piece, timed to coincide the midterm elections in the US, contains false and exaggerated claims aimed to discredit Biden’s presidency and the US.For instance, the claim that the US is currently suffering from the previously unseen level of crimes is false. While in 2000 over 500 violent offenses were recorded per 100,000 people in the US, that figure was around 396 in 2021. ""The longer-term trend for violent crime in the US since the 1990s has been generally downwards, although over the past few years it has remained relatively stable, according to FBI data"", the BBC relevant journalist report says.More broadly, the publication is consistent with the recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative that the US and the West are on the brink of an imminent collapse. Russian and pro-Kremlin disinformation outlets regularly employ this narrative, explained in our earlier analysis in detail. Examples include: the EU is on the verge of collapse, the US is collapsing, NATO is breaking down, Ukraine’s entry into the EU would provoke the bloc’s collapse, and the financial system is collapsing.Furthermore, through false claims that the US Democrats are carrying out gender experiments with kids and pushing people to change their gender the publication promotes the ‘threatened values’ disinformation narrative. The idea of a decaying West is often juxtaposed in the pro-Kremlin outlets against Russia that is the ‘guardian’ of decency and morality. See earlier cases alleging that in contrast to Russia, western Europe is abandoning Christian roots and that, unlike Russia, the West is not about fairness or solidarity and it degrades traditional values and endangers societies, while all-Russian history is highly moral.

"No factual basis confirms the statement that the current Federal President Frank-Walter-Steinmeier maintains parallels with the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. This is an adapted disinformation narrative from pro-Kremlin outlets accusing the West of Russophobia or being Nazi or fascist.The smear campaign against Frank Walter Steinmeier found its start after a recent speech on 28 October 2022, in which Federal President Steinmeier delivered a speech titled ""Strengthening everything that connects us"".In the entire speech, Steinmeier self-critically reflects on the Federal Republic of Germany's Russia policy in the past and in the present. A single sentence on the treatment of Russian culture and music is torn out of its overall context and reproduced as an anti-Russian, russophobic statement. However, the statement is of no relevance in the overall context of his speech, i.e. the political changes since 24 February, as Steinmeier points out numerous times in his speech. For example, Steinmeier calls the start of Russia's war of aggression on 24 February 2022 ""the definitive, bitter failure of years of political efforts, including my own.""""24. February was an epochal shift. It plunged us here in Germany, too, into a different time, into an uncertainty that we thought we had left behind us, a time marked by war, violence and displacement, by concerns that the war would spread across Europe like wildfire. A time of severe economic upheaval, of energy crisis."" ""Russia's brutal war of aggression in Ukraine has reduced the European security order to ashes. In his imperial obsession, the Russian President has broken international law, committed land grabs, called borders into question. The Russian attack is an attack on all of the lessons that the world had learned from the last century's two World Wars.""Referring to Russian culture and ""old dreams"" Steinmeier concludes: ""But when we look at today's Russia, there simply is no place for old dreams. Our countries are today opposed. Putin is commanding an invading army, and the Ukrainians are defending their country, which they have been building since their independence thirty years ago. Russia's war of aggression has demolished Gorbachev's dream of a ""common European home"". It is an attack on the law, on the principles of the renunciation of violence and of inviolable borders.The quotes used and comparisons with the Nazi propaganda minister Goebbels have no basis.

"Recurrent false pro-Kremlin narrative on US biological weapons in Ukraine.Russian unfounded allegations about US-funded bio-laboratories in Ukraine for military purposes have been repeatedly debunked, including by the UN High Representative for Disarmament Affairs Izumi Nakamitsu, but pro-Kremlin outlets and Russian authorities continue promoting these disinformation narratives.In reality, all laboratories located in Ukraine are controlled by the Ukrainian government and do not carry out military research. In August 2005, the US and Ukrainian governments made an agreement to prevent the spread of dangerous pathogens and relevant expertise and to diminish potential biological risks. Partially, this agreement was aimed at modernising state laboratories in Odesa, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk and other regions, consisting of upgrading lab equipment and repairs of premises. The US Embassy in Ukraine previously addressed the claims about supposed bio-military labs in Ukraine, stating that this is a fabricated accusation in pro-Kremlin propaganda that aims to hinder the ongoing U.S.-Ukrainian partnership to reduce biological threats.There is no clear evidence that the COVID-19 coronavirus had an artificial origin. The narrative about the so-called “ethnic weapon” has been a core staple of Kremlin-backed disinformation over the years and has been dismissed as science fiction.The US and Ukraine are signatory States of the binding UN Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction entered into force in 1975.See similar cases in our database: Russia presented evidence of US biolabs in Ukraine at the Convention on biological weapons; US develop biological weapons at the border with Russia; The US admitted conducting biological experiments on Ukrainian citizens.

"The allegation is part of a broader disinformation campaign to prepare the ground and justify the illegal annexation of Ukrainian territories by Russia.Mariupol cannot be considered a Russian city under any prism. Prior to WWI it was part of the Russian Empire, but so was most of the rest of Ukraine and a big part of what is today Polish territory (see map here). After the outbreak of the Ukrainian-Soviet war in 1917, it became part of the so-called Ukrainian People’s Republic and was afterwards occupied by German and Austrian troops as a result of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. In 1921, it became part of the new Socialist Republic of Ukraine, which was soon integrated in the USSR. Mariupol was always recognised by Russian authorities as Ukrainian territory, both during Soviet times and after Ukraine’s independence in 1991.See other examples of similar disinformation narratives, such as claims that a referendum and a coup forced Luhansk and Donetsk to declare independence, that the Russian liberation of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk ended discrimination and abuse, that “Azov” admitted in a secret document that the majority of Mariupol residents support Russia, or that the Financial Times reported that Ukraine threatened Russia with terrorist attacks on its territory.

In fact, Ukraine has never turned to foreign partners for blood or its components, as Ukraine has established a national blood service that provides patients with laboratory-tested, high-quality blood.This letter published by the Ministry of Health of Ukraine on November 7th states that since the first day of the war, citizens of Ukraine have been systematically making planned donations, which ensures a stable supply of blood. The Ministry of Health of Ukraine further stated that the document distributed by the Russian media, which allegedly reflects the letter written by the Minister of Health of Ukraine to the Prime Minister, proving the detection of HIV and hepatitis in the blood samples, is fabricated, as the document does not meet the requirements for issuing official documents in Ukraine.Read the full debunk at Myth Detector.

Neither the European Union nor Western countries have declared war to Russia or want to escalate the war in Ukraine. Western nations have always been calling for solving all problems with Russia in a peaceful and diplomatic manner. Moscow’s overall aggressive policy has led to a tougher and better-balanced policy towards it by the West.On the contrary, it is Russia that refused the diplomatic process and started an unprovoked war in Europe, capturing more and more territories of a neighbouring country and has created a serious danger to European security, while using nuclear threats.Some NATO member states are providing Ukraine with military assistance to repel the unprovoked Russian aggression, but they are not involved in direct fighting.

"This claim is demonstrably false, and aims at undermining the importance of Ukraine to the world economy, as well as undermining the global economic impact of Russia's unjustified and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine is one of the world's major grain producers. In fact, Ukraine accounts for 10% of the world wheat market, 15% of the corn market, and 13% of the barley market. It is also the main producer sunflower oil. When grain deliveries were initially suspended as a result of Russia's blockade of Ukrainian ports, this caused grain prices to sky-rocket. By mid-May, export prices for wheat and corn had reached unprecedented heights. Prices have also dropped once Ukrainian grain ships were allowed to leave Black Sea ports as a result of the grain deal, signed in July by Turkiye, Ukraine, Russia and the United Nations to unblock the Black Sea for Ukrainian exports of grains."
"A recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about an alleged loss of sovereignty of the EU and its member states. Pro-Kremlin outlets often portray European states as vassals, puppet-states or colonies of the US.Contrary to the claim, the European Union is a sovereign entity created by the voluntary initiative of European nations and it has its own, independent foreign policy, while the US has no say in its decisions.EU Member States are sovereign countries and make sovereign decisions about their own internal, economic, foreign and security policies. The European Union is explicit on the subject of national sovereignty: “the Member States all remain sovereign and independent states, they have decided to pool some of their 'sovereignty' in areas where it makes sense to work together.”The aims and values on which the European Union is founded on the pursuit of peace, the well-being of its citizens, freedom, security and justice.

"Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative aiming to deflect Russia’s responsibility for the growing food crisis and supply insecurity by claiming that most of Ukraine's grain ships are sent to rich European countries. This claim was neither counterbalanced nor critically challenged in the article.This false allegation goes in line with a wider pro-Kremlin disinformation campaign aiming to blame Western countries for a global food crisis engineered by Russia as part of its unjustified aggression against Ukraine.Russia's responsibility for the global food crisis comes as a consequence of the unprovoked and unjustified Russian invasion of Ukraine: naval blockade of Ukrainian posts, bombardment of transport infrastructure and shelling of farming regions. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has destabilised global food markets and is driving food prices up due to increased cost of production, transport and freight insurance. Russia has destroyed substantial food stocks, production, as well as processing and transport capacities in Ukraine.As can be seen from the database of the UN Black Sea Grain Initiative, as of 23 September, out of the 203 shipments, less then half, only 92 - headed to EU countries. The majority headed for other countries like Turkey, Egypt, China, and India. Besides, this doesn’t mean that these are their final destinations, as grain will be redistributed from some of these harbours to other countries.See also article 15. of the conclusions of the European Council of 20 and 21 October 2022 which states:Russia, by weaponising food in its war against Ukraine, is solely responsible for the global food security crisis it has provoked. Russia’s war of aggression has triggered disruptions of agricultural production, supply chains and trade that have driven world food and fertiliser prices to unprecedented levels. The EU-Ukraine Solidarity Lanes have made possible the export of significant volumes of Ukrainian crops, agricultural products and fertilisers to the countries most in need.See other similar disinformation narratives in our database, such as claims that EU is causing a global food shortage by keeping all the grain from Ukraine; Only 3% of Ukrainian grains end up in poor countries; the rest go to EU countries; The EU kept most of the ships with Ukrainian grain, only 2 went to developing countries.

"Recurrent pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives, challenging Ukraine’s statehood and presenting Poland as a state with imperial ambitions.This disinformation message has adopted several different and sometimes contradictory forms, including allegations that Poland wants either to create a puppet proxy-state in Western Ukraine or the annexation of these territories or that it is actually President Zelenskyy who wants to cede this land due to his “Polish origin”. In fact, the claims regarding the seizure of Ukraine by the Poles are false and groundless. Poland adheres to international law regarding state borders, fully supports the independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, it does not have any territorial claims against its neighbours and it rejects any “imperial” ambitions towards other countries.

Poland, as well as the EU and the US respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. No neighbouring state, except the Russian Federation, violated Ukraine's territorial integrity.As for the claim about the special rights of Poles in Ukraine: On 12 March 2022 the Polish parliament passed an act on assistance for Ukrainian nationals in connection with Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The special purpose act, in addition to regulating a number of issues related to the refugee’s stay in Poland, allows for favorable tax treatment of humanitarian aid expenditures incurred by corporations.In return, Ukrainian President Zelensky submitted a draft bill to the Verkhovna Rada on the status and assistance to Polish citizens in Ukraine, which is similar to the one, which has recently been endorsed by the Sejm of Poland in relation to Ukrainians. The pro-Kremlin claim that Poland is preparing to seize the Ukrainian territories is manipulation and misrepresentation of this gesture. See earlier disinformation cases alleging that Poland thinks that Western Ukraine, Western Belarus and South-Western Lithuania belong to them, that Poland wants to dismember Ukraine and re-establish a Polish empire, that Ukraine is a Western colony belonging to Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Russia, that Poland will try to gain full military control in Ukrainian territories under the guise of protecting the Polish population from Russia, that Poland plans to establish control over its historical lands in Ukraine.

However, the British Defense Ministry has officially denied any accusations of terrorism by stating that “To detract from their disastrous handling of the illegal invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence is resorting to peddling false claims of an epic scale”. Ukraine has neither confirmed nor denied it was behind the attacks.

The history of Ukraine dates back to the era of the Kyivan Rus’ in the 9th-13th centuries. A fully independent Ukraine only emerged in the 20th century, after long periods of successive domination by Poland-Lithuania, Russia, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).In the aftermath of World War I and the disintegration of the Russian and Austro-Hungarian Empires two states were created: the Ukrainian People's Republic (UNR) and the West Ukrainian People's Republic. They merged into a unified state - the Ukrainian People's Republic - on 22 January 1919. Under Lenin's leadership at the beginning of the 20th century, Ukraine was occupied by the Bolsheviks and for decades was under communist control.Under Lenin's leadership at the beginning of the 20th century, Ukraine was occupied by the Bolsheviks and for decades was under communist control. When the Soviet Union began to unravel in 1990–91, the legislature of the Ukrainian SSR declared sovereignty (July 16, 1990) and then full independence (August 24, 1991). With the dissolution of the USSR in December 1991, Ukraine gained full independence which was also recognised by Russia under late president Yeltsin of the Russian Federation.The ""all-Russian big nation"" is an imperial Russian and Russian revanchist ideology that is a favoured pro-Kremlin narrative aimed at weakening the national identity of Ukrainians, as well as undermining the state sovereignty.Ukraine is a sovereign and independent state with a democratically-elected president and parliament. Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are respected by almost the whole world with Russia as the key exception.Pro-Kremlin media outlets often cast doubts on Ukrainian statehood and claim that Ukraine either does not exist as a state or is going to tumble down very soon, or it is a colony of the West.Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity have been violated by continuous acts of aggression by Russian armed forces since 2014 and culminated in an aggressive full-scale attack on a neighbouring country on February 24, 2022.

The myth of Nazi-ruled Ukraine has been the cornerstone of Russian disinformation about the country since the very beginning of the 2013-14 Euromaidan protests, when it was used to discredit the pro-European popular uprising in Kyiv and, subsequently, the broader pro-Western shift in Ukraine's foreign policy. See our recent article Key Narratives in Pro-Kremlin Disinformation “Nazis” - EUvsDisinfo.Meanwhile, EU member states have adopted regulations to fill gas storages and share them in a spirit of solidarity, diversified supply sources and committed to reducing gas demand by 15% this winter. Despite recent events, and in particular the attacks on the Nord Stream Pipelines, Europe is prepared to face this winter. EU underground gas reserves have been filled by almost 90% of their capacity, well ahead of the 1 November deadline set in the gas storage regulation.

It offers an absurd interpretation of the Russian military invasion of Ukraine with the use of the classic disinformation narrative about the Russian world.The notion that Ukraine is not a country, but a historical part of Russia, appears to be deeply ingrained in the minds of Russian leadership (see here, here and here.)Ukraine is a well-defined nation-state with a long history and its own identity, despite foreign rule for long periods of time. The ""all-Russian big nation"" is an imperial Russian and Russian revanchist ideology that is a favoured pro-Kremlin narrative aimed at weakening the national identity of Ukrainians, as well as undermining the state sovereignty and territorial integrity.Ukraine is a sovereign and independent state with an internationally recognised territory and borders, democratically elected president and parliament. It is a member of many international organisations, such as the United Nations and the Council of Europe, and a party to international agreements. Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are respected by almost the whole world with Russia as the key exception.The occupied Ukrainian territories are not Russian and not ""liberated"", but temporarily occupied territories as a result of Russia's aggression against Ukraine. The referendums are shams, conducted in haste and under military repression and as far from the ""public will of the people"" as imaginable.Pro-Kremlin media outlets often cast doubts on Ukrainian statehood and claim that Ukraine either does not exist as a state or is going to tumble down very soon, or it is a colony of the West. In reality, present-day Ukraine has been on the world map since 1991 when the Soviet Union disintegrated. It has elected six presidents since then and changed parties in government several times which illustrates political diversity and democratic dynamics even during economic hardship in the wake of Russian aggression in 2014.Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity have been violated by continuous acts of aggression by Russian armed forces since 2014 and culminated in an aggressive attack on a neighbouring country on February 24, 2022.See similar disinformation cases that target Ukraine: that There is no Ukraine: Russia liberates Russian cities; that Ukraine does not exist as a state; that Ukraine will be split up; that Ukraine is a quasi-state with a failed economy; that modern Ukraine was created as a country for death in the name of American interests and others.

"The claim is false. Although it is true that Russia destroyed a large stock of chemical weapons on September 2017, as the OPCW certified at the time, this was only its remaining declared stock, which Russia was obliged to destroy since 2007 under the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention, although the country benefited from several extensions to maintain chemical weapons. Russia not only possesses other undeclared stocks, but it has repeatedly used chemical weapons against its perceived enemies both in Russia and abroad, as the cases of Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny, Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and Bulgarian arms dealer Emilian Gebrev show. Significantly, the attacks on Skripal and Navalny took place after 2017, when Russia was supposed to be already free of chemical weapons, and led to the imposition of sanctions against Russian officials and institutions.On the other side, the US White House has emphasised that the US “is in full compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological Weapons Convention and does not develop or possess such weapons anywhere”. This comes in accordance with previous reports that the US has destroyed about 90% of the chemical weapons stockpile in a process that started in June 2019, and it is scheduled to be eliminated by Dec. 31, 2023, after the construction of the necessary destruction facilities.See other examples of similar disinformation narratives, such as the claims that unlike the US, Russia eliminated all its stocks of chemical weapons, that the poisoning of drug addict Navalny was a hoax, that the Skripal case is crumbling due to the lack of evidence, or that the OPCW is turning into an instrument for serving the geopolitical interests of the West.

"This is a recurring disinformation narrative from pro-Kremlin outlets accusing the Ukrainian Armed Forces of hitting critical civilian infrastructure. This claim was made in the context of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and is meant to distract from and obfuscate Russia's own actions in Ukraine. No evidence is provided to support the claim that Ukrainian troops are firing at the Kakhovska hydroelectric power. A Ukrainian military spokesperson has stated that the Russian forces keep intervening on the water supplies at the Kakhovska power plant. They are trying to drain the water from its reservoirs. According to the Ukrainian Army, Russian soldiers have mined the station, left only loyal people there and limited access to the station. Russia is threatening to blow up a dam at the station, which would flood vast areas down the River Dnipro, including large areas of the city of Kherson. Russia hasa history of accusing Ukraine of false flag actions it would supposedly carries out against own targets. Previously, Russian troops staged similar actions at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, as they shelled it and accused Ukraine.Russia routinely claims that atrocities, which have been proven to have been committed by Russian units, were the works of Ukrainian army; Bucha, Mariupol et cetera.

"Recurring disinformation about Western sanctions on Russia, connected with unproven speculation about a migration crisis. The EU and other countries around the world adopted several sanction packages against Russia due to its illegal aggression and occupation of Ukrainian territories. Not all trade restrictions are yet enforced as the energy sector needs longer transition periods, so it is too early to assess the full effect of the sanctions. However, it is incorrect to state that the Russian economy would be barely affected or would even benefit from the sanctions. Otherwise, the Russian leadership would not feel the need to constantly demand the sanctions be removed.It is also Russia's unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine that is hurting the global economy, and not sanctions against Russia. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has destabilised global food markets and is driving food prices up due to increased cost of production, transport and freight insurance. Russia has also destroyed substantial food stocks, production, as well as processing and transport capacities in Ukraine. It also affects the economy of the EU but there are no signs of “destruction”.A recent study from Yale University takes a detailed look into the effects sanctions are having on the Russian economy, concluding that ""business retreats and sanctions are catastrophically crippling the Russian economy.""See also the assessment of EU HRVP Josep Borrell demonstrating that the sanction policy is working and strongly impacts the Russian economy.See similar cases about Western sanctions on Russia: If the West wants to assist Russia and China, they should add more sanctions; EU sanctions are hurting Europe more than Russia; Anti-Russian sanctions are illegal pressure.

"This is a recurring disinformation narrative from pro-Kremlin media denying Ukrainian statehood by claiming that it is part of ""historical Russia"". This claim was neither counterbalanced nor critically challenged in the article.In reality, the territory of present-day Ukraine had been divided between the Russian Empire and the Austrian-Hungarian Empire for centuries. Many new countries appeared in Europe in the wake of Russia’s Bolshevik revolution in 1917 and World War One (1914-1918), the Ukrainian People’s republic (aka the Ukrainian National Republic) being one of these. It was later occupied by Communist Russia and forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union. Ukraine assumed its internationally recognised borders in 1991 when the USSR broke up.It is true that Ukrainians and Russians share a common history, have similar languages and are mostly Orthodox Christian believers. Many neighbouring European nations have a common history, linguistic similarity and religious affinity as well. Although some of them were parts of other, bigger states at some point in history, all modern European nations are now equal and independent states.Moreover, Russia was not forced to invade Ukraine.

"Disinformation narrative from pro-Kremlin outlets accusing the EU of aggravating the situation in Ukraine, being unwilling to assist in bringing an end to the war and disrupting peace efforts. Western leaders have continuously called for talks and a peaceful solution to stop Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, but Moscow has been ignoring these efforts. Western nations did everything they could to prevent the war and have only been reacting to Russia’s full invasion. The US, the EU and some NATO member states provide Ukraine with military assistance to repel the unprovoked Russian aggression. Ukraine receives weapons with the sole aim of restoring its territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders. On 17 October 2022, the European Council adopted additional assistance measures under the European Peace Facility (EPF) to further support the capabilities and resilience of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. With this, the EU is further stepping up its support to Ukraine to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders, and protect the civilian population against the ongoing Russian war of aggression. Previous assistance measures under the EPF for Ukraine were agreed on 28 February, 23 March, 13 April, 23 May and 21 July 2022.""The mobilisation of an additional €500 million by EU member states is yet another proof that we remain steadfast in our support to the Ukrainian armed forces to defend the country against the escalating illegal aggression"", Josep Borrell, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy stated.

"This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about sanctions in the context of the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. The claim was neither counterbalanced nor critically challenged in the article.The claim that sanctions are the cause of economic crisis is an attempt to deflect Russia's responsibility for the global food and energy crisis. In fact, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has destabilised global food markets and is driving food prices up due to increased cost of production, transport and freight insurance. Russia has also destroyed substantial food stocks, production, as well as processing and transport capacities in Ukraine.Logistically, EU sanctions do not include the import of agricultural products unless a sanctioned individual is involved. Moreover, the sanctions only cover bilateral trade between the EU and Russia, meaning that third countries can import Russian agrifood products without restriction, and therefore there is no bases for the claim that EU sanctions are the cause of the crisis in developing countries. See article 15. of the conclusions of the European Council of 20 and 21 October 2022 which states:Russia, by weaponising food in its war against Ukraine, is solely responsible for the global food security crisis it has provoked.

"Recurrent pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about biological weapons being secretly developed by the US in countries bordering Russia. This narrative is a leitmotif in a years-old disinformation campaign conducted by the Kremlin and is currently deployed in an attempt to justify Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.Some of the most bizarre and yet enduring Kremlin disinformation narratives have been those accusing the West of running clandestine biological research programmes to wreak havoc around the world. In reality, all laboratories located in Ukraine are controlled by the Ukrainian government and don’t carry out military research. In August 2005, the US and Ukrainian governments made an agreement to prevent the spread of dangerous pathogens and relevant expertise and to diminish potential biological risks. Partially, this agreement was aimed at modernising state laboratories in Odesa, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk and other regions, consisting of upgrading lab equipment and repairs of premises.The US Embassy in Ukraine previously addressed the claims about supposed bio-military labs in Ukraine, stating that this is a fabricated accusation in pro-Kremlin propaganda that aims to hinder the ongoing U.S.-Ukrainian partnership to reduce biological threats. The accusations are part of the Kremlin’s broader, long-lasting disinformation campaign to discredit the US in the eyes of Putin’s pro-Western neighbours such as Georgia and Ukraine.See other examples of similar disinformation narratives in our database, such as claims that Russia presented evidence of US biolabs in Ukraine at the Convention on biological weapons, that US develop biological weapons at the border with Russia, that new evidence of US military-biological activity emerged in Ukraine, that Zelenskyy ordered the destruction of evidence regarding the development of biological weapons, or that bio-experiments in US labs turned Ukrainian soldiers into ‘most cruel monsters’.

"Pro-Kremlin narrative on the energy crisis in Europe amid the unprovoked Russian invasion of Ukraine, subsequent Western sanctions on Russia and Russian retaliatory measures reducing gas supplies.The article contains a recurrent pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative claiming that Europe has no hope to solve the energy crisis will inevitably deepen without restoring the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines. This narrative plays into the Kremlin's claims that the West is collapsing. The Kremlin seeks to pressure and blackmail the European governments and create public panic over energy insecurity / energy costs.Meanwhile EU member states have adopted a regulation to fill gas storages and share them in a spirit of solidarity, diversified supply sources and committed to reducing gas demand by 15% this winter. Despite recent events, and in particular the attacks on the Nord Stream Pipelines, Europe is prepared to face this winter. EU underground gas reserves have been filled by almost 90% of their capacity, well ahead of the 1 November deadline set in the gas storage regulation. This means that with the predicted gas consumption reduction and filled gas reserves, Europe won’t be out of gas for the winter even without Russian gas. See also sections II.

"Recurrent pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about a ‘Deep State’ in the United States which rules above elected officials. This narrative aims to question the legitimacy of democracy and Western institutions. No evidence is presented to back up these claims. No reputable political scientists or researchers confirm the existence of a ‘Deep State’ in the United States.The claim also suggests that the US is responsible for the war in Ukraine to the extent that it would ""lead the world into extinction"". The war in Ukraine began in 2014 with the illegal annexation of Crimea and Russia's military involvement and support of separatist in Donbas. Russia’s protracted invasion of Ukraine was unprovoked and unjustified. Days before the invasion in February, Putin had offered several reasons for launching aggression, including the necessity to help prevent a genocide in non-government-controlled territories in Eastern Ukraine, Ukraine’s alleged desire to obtain nuclear weapons and Kyiv’s possible membership of NATO. These were only pretexts because Putin had seemingly taken the decision to invade Ukraine long before. In late 2021 and early 2022, Western nations were trying to conduct a constructive dialogue with Moscow on all disputed issues including security guarantees. Russia put forth excessive demands, so the West had to decline them. Russia opted for a policy of confrontation, which is why these discussions achieved no breakthrough. See our account of the Russian demands here and about Seven Popular Russian Myths here. See other examples of these disinformation narratives, such as claims that the result of the US 2020 election doesn’t matter because the real ruler is the Deep State, which will kill any US president that confronts it and is moving the country towards war with Iran and Russia; that Hillary Clinton published the Deep State strategy for the world; and that the Ukraine crisis was provoked by the West.

"Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative aiming to deflect Russia’s responsibility for the growing food crisis and supply insecurity by claiming that most of Ukraine's grain ships are sent to rich European countries. This false allegation goes in line with a wider pro-Kremlin disinformation campaign aiming to blame Western countries for a global food crisis engineered by Russia as part of its unjustified aggression against Ukraine.Russia's responsibility for the global food crisis comes as a consequence of the unprovoked and unjustified Russian invasion of Ukraine: naval blockade of Ukrainian posts, bombardment of transport infrastructure and shelling of farming regions. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has destabilised global food markets and is driving food prices up due to increased cost of production, transport and freight insurance. Russia has destroyed substantial food stocks, production, as well as processing and transport capacities in Ukraine.As can be seen from the database of the UN Black Sea Grain Initiative, as of 23 September, out of the 203 shipments, less then half, only 92 - headed to EU countries. The majority headed for other countries like Turkey, Egypt, China, and India. Besides, this doesn’t mean that these are their final destinations, as grain will be redistributed from some of these harbours to other countries.See also article 15. of the conclusions of the European Council of 20 and 21 October 2022 which states:Russia, by weaponising food in its war against Ukraine, is solely responsible for the global food security crisis it has provoked.

There is no evidence of Israel ever supporting anti-Semitism in any way.

It offers an absurd interpretation of the Russian military invasion of Ukraine with the use of the classic disinformation narrative about the Russian world.Ukraine is a well-defined nation with a long history and its own literature and identity. The history of Ukraine dates back to the era of the Kyivan Rus’ in the 9th-13th centuries. A fully independent Ukraine only emerged in the 20th century, after long periods of successive domination by Poland-Lithuania, Russia, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).In the aftermath of World War I and the disintegration of the Russian and Austro-Hungarian Empires two states were created: the Ukrainian People's Republic (UNR) and the West Ukrainian People's Republic. They merged into a unified state - the Ukrainian People's Republic - on 22 January 1919. Under Lenin's leadership at the beginning of the 20th century, Ukraine was occupied by the Bolsheviks and for decades was under communist control.Under Lenin's leadership at the beginning of the 20th century, Ukraine was occupied by the Bolsheviks and for decades was under communist control. When the Soviet Union began to unravel in 1990–91, the legislature of the Ukrainian SSR declared sovereignty (July 16, 1990) and then fullindependence (August 24, 1991). With the dissolution of the USSR in December 1991, Ukraine gained full independence which was also recognised byRussia under late president Yeltsin of the Russian Federation.The ""all-Russian big nation"" is an imperial Russian and Russian revanchist ideology that is a favoured pro-Kremlin narrative aimed at weakening the national identity of Ukrainians, as well as undermining the state sovereignty.Ukraine is a sovereign and independent state with a democratically-elected president and parliament.

"The message presents a collection of by now well-known and widely debunked disinformation narratives about Ukraine and Russia's full-on war on Ukraine.There was no coup d'état in Ukraine.

See the full debunk of this disinformation claim here.Ukraine is not a dictatorship. Volodymyr Zelenskyy was elected during free democratic elections in 2019. He supported more than 73 per cent of voters.

Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity have been violated by continuous acts of aggression by Russian armed forces since 2014.

"The claim is demonstrably false and intende to discredit the Ukrainian president. The footage used as “proof” in this disinformation story belongs to a moment when the Ukrainian president posed in front of a chroma screen in order to appear as a hologram in several tech festivals throughout the world in June 2022, an episode that was widely reported at the time. The video used as “evidence” was released on social media by Talesmith, the technological firm that made it possible, and in no way shows what this disinformation story alleges. A classic disinfo trick of taking things out of context.The second purpose of this disinformation narrative is to create doubts about reports on Russian atrocities in Ukraine, despite massive evidence proving them including witness and victims' testimonies, video footage, satellite images and forensic findings. On 23 September 2022, the UN reported that its investigators concluded that Russia had committed multiple war crimes in Ukraine, including bombings of civilian areas, executions, torture and sexual violence.See other examples of similar disinformation narratives, such as claims that the West fights Russia through psy-ops like Bucha and the Mariupol maternity hospital, that Russian war crimes in Bucha were staged by a music channel director, that ‘Izyum atrocities’ were staged by Ukraine through controlled media, or that Zelenskyy is only a marketing operation, a Jewish face for a Nazi regime.

"Recurring narrative on the West campaigning against Russia. On 12 October, 2022, with 143 votes in favour, 5 against, the UN General Assembly adopts Resolution condemning Russian Federation’s annexation of four eastern Ukraine regions: Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia. It was the highest number of votes against Russia since the invasion.""These acts are a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the United Nations Charter"", the Assembly declared. It called on all States, international organisations and United Nations agencies not to recognise any alteration by the Russian Federation of the status of the four regions of Ukraine.Only 5 countries (Belarus, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Nicaragua, Russian Federation, Syria) voted against the resolution. The countries which voted with Russia all have a longstanding stance of criticising Western governments. Belarus is considered a satellite state of its neighbour and ally, and its territory was used in Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February.China and India have attempted to remain neutral on the conflict. Parties that abstained from the vote included 19 nations in Africa. Many African countries have avoided taking sides in the war - which has been seen as a reflection of efforts to maintain longstanding trade ties, or of historic non-alignment policies.Lobbying is a usual practice in international relations. The Russian Federation itself also actively lobbies its interests. e.g. three of four states that were visited by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in July - Congo-Brazzaville, Ethiopia and Uganda - chose to abstain.Meanwhile, all four nations that featured on a recent trip by Ukraine's own foreign minister - Ghana, Ivory Coast, Kenya and Senegal - voted at the UN to condemn Russia.

Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are respected by almost the whole world with Russia as the key exception.The occupied Ukrainian territories/cities are not Russian and not ""liberated"" as the publication claims, but temporarily occupied territories as a result of Russia's aggression against Ukraine. The referendums are shams, conducted in haste and under military repression and as far from the ""public will of the people"" as imaginable.Pro-Kremlin media outlets often cast doubts on Ukrainian statehood and claim that Ukraine either does not exist as a state or is going to tumble down very soon, or it is a colony of the West. In reality, present-day Ukraine has been on the world map since 1991 when the Soviet Union disintegrated. It has elected six presidents since then and changed parties in government several times which illustrates political diversity and democratic dynamics even during economic hardship in the wake of Russian aggression in 2014.Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity have been violated by continuous acts of aggression by Russian armed forces since 2014 and culminated in an aggressive attack on a neighbouring country on February 24, 2022.See similar disinformation cases that target Ukraine: that Ukraine does not exist as a state; that Ukraine will be split up; that Ukraine is a quasi-state with a failed economy; that modern Ukraine was created as a country for death in the name of American interests and others.

"Unfounded pro-Kremlin disinformation intended to discredit the Ukrainian President. No evidence given to support the claim.The disinformation appeared in the context of Russia’s new wave of violent airstrikes carried out throughout Ukraine on October 10th, targeting multiple cities, including the capital. It was first claimed by the pro-Kremlin outlets, citing the former Ukrainian Rada MP Illia Kyva, that Zelenskyy fled Kyiv and he was headed for the Polish border. However, shortly after Zelenskyy uploaded a video address, taken in the vicinity of the presidential palace, proving that he remains in Kyiv. This prompted the pro-Kremlin media to twist their disinfo claim, alleging that the President of Ukraine was forced to return, that the West did not allow Zelenskyy to escape from Kyiv.In reality, videos of Zelenskyy released on October 10th, as well as his meeting with the US ambassador in Kyiv, prove that the president remained in Kyiv, therefore, claims that Zelenskyy fled Kyiv and then was forced to return back are groundless.Read the full debunk of this disinformation at Myth Detector.

"The material and links may contain distressing/ graphic content.The claim advances a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative regarding Russia’s ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine.There is no conclusive evidence showing that Ukraine was responsible for the bridge explosion, nor has Kyiv claimed responsibility for the incident. However, even if we accept the Kremlin’s version of events - namely that the explosion was perpetrated by Ukraine’s military intelligence - this does not change the fact that this purported attack would constitute not an act of terrorism, but lawful sabotage under international humanitarian law (IHL).Throughout Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Crimean Bridge has been a vital military supply route between Russian territory and occupied Crimea. Under the Geneva Conventions, this allows for counting the bridge among those facilities which “make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction [...], in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage [para. 2]”; in turn this, disqualifies it as a protected civilian object.On the other hand, Russia’s retaliatory attacks hit a number of non-military facilities, residential centres, and cultural sites across Ukraine, resulting in dozens of civilian deaths. In particular, extensive material damage and numerous casualties were seen in Kyiv, a city located hundreds of kilometres away from the frontline. Given the sheer number of indiscriminate attacks on areas with no discernible military use [para. 4], Russia has come much closer than Ukraine to conducting military operations “the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population - see Article 51(2) of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions.See here for an in-depth legal analysis of the Crimean Bridge explosion and the Russian response.

"This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about sanctions in the context of the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. In this case, this narrative is also used to attack the Organisation of American States, a frequent target of pro-Kremlin criticism as this institution has been very critical of several countries allied of Moscow such as Venezuela or Nicaragua. Russia’s status as permanent observer at OAS was suspended in April 2022 as a result of Russia’s invasion.The claim that sanctions are the cause of global food and energy crisis is an attempt to deflect Russia's responsibility in this situation. Large-scale wars are, by definition, bound to cause global supply shocks that trigger inflation and chain disruptions. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has destabilised global food markets and is driving food prices up due to increased cost of production, transport and freight insurance. Russia has also destroyed substantial food stocks, production, as well as processing and transport capacities in Ukraine.The allegation that the US and the EU don’t care about starving Latin Americans is demonstrably false. EU sanctions do not include trade with Ukraine. As for trade with Russia, the sanctions do not include the import of agricultural products unless a sanctioned individual is involved. Moreover, the sanctions only cover bilateral trade between the EU and Russia, meaning that third countries can import Russian agrifood products without restriction. The US also exempts transactions for food, agricultural products and medical supplies from sanctions. "

"Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the illegal annexation of Crimea. Crimea is a part of Ukraine and was illegally annexed by Russia. Crimea is an internationally recognised part of Ukraine. Іn 1997, by signing the Friendship Agreement with Ukraine, Russia also recognised that Crimea belongs to Ukraine.On the 1991 Crimea sovereignty referendum, voters were asked whether they wanted to re-establish the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. 94% of voters supported the proposal, and the Supreme Council of Ukrainian SSR established the autonomous Crimean Republic within the territory of Ukraine. After Ukraine adopted a new constitution in 1996, Crimea maintained its autonomy. Crimea has its own parliament and government.In 2014, Russian troops obliged the parliament of Crimea to organise a so-called referendum, which was illegitimate under international law, and then formally annexed the peninsula and brought it under Russian territorial control.No international body recognises the so-called referendum in 2014. The UN General Assembly adopted a resolution entitled “Territorial integrity of Ukraine”, stating that the referendum in Crimea was not valid and could not serve as a basis for any change in the status of the peninsula. On 17 December 2018, the UN General Assembly confirmed its non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea.Historical background: Crimea was annexed by Russian empire, then containing Ukraine, in 1783, already in violation of a treaty which guaranteed the independence of the Tatar khanate. In 1897, the first comprehensive census of the population of the empire indicates that the Russians are only one third of the inhabitants of Crimea, where they are still slightly fewer than the indigenous Crimean Tatars. The Russians only became a majority after the complete deportation in 1944 of the Tatars, who could only return after the fall of the communist regime. The annexation of Crimea to the then Soviet Ukraine, in 1954, was not done on a not ethnic, but geographical and economic basis, since the peninsula was adjoining and economically depending from the mainland areas, it means, Ukraine. At that, in 1937 Russian Soviet Socialist Republic received Taganrog from Ukrainian Socialist Republic. But Russia is not ready to ""give this gift back "" to Ukraine. There were several interchanges of territories between USSR's republics, which are all now sovereign States recognised by international law.Read also related cases: Russia has never violated the provisions of the Budapest Memorandum, Crimea rejoined Russia as a result of a popular referendum, Accusing Russia of annexing Crimea is ignoring its historical rights to the peninsula, Ukraine, USA and EU recognised the reunification of Crimea with Russia.

"This disinformation claim came as a comment on the alleged call of Zelenskyy for NATO countries to launch a preemptive strike on Russia, before it used nuclear weapons against Ukraine.

Any nuclear explosion may have unpredictable consequences for the whole world. It is Russia who is making irresponsible hints and statements about the possibility of using nuclear arms in its war against Ukraine. According to Russia’s military doctrine, it can use such weapons “in response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction against it and/or its allies, and also in case of aggression against Russia with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is threatened"". Ukraine’s counter-offensive aimed at retaking its territories and its attacks on military facilities in the illegally annexed peninsula of Crimea are posing no existential threats to Russia, so it cannot use nuclear weapons, in accordance with its own doctrine.Russia is trying to keep the international community in suspense with contradictory statements about using nuclear weapons. Its Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russia may apply its nuclear doctrine to protect newly occupied Ukrainian territories if they are enshrined in the Russian constitution. At the same time, President Vladimir Putin accused the West in his recent speech about the annexation of occupied Ukrainian territories of blackmail and intimidation.

"The article contains a recurrent pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative claiming that European industry will shut down and the energy crisis will inevitably deepen without restoring the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines. This narrative addresses the energy crisis in Europe amid the unprovoked Russian invasion of Ukraine, the subsequent Western counter measures towards Russia and the Kremlin’s retaliatory limiting of gas supplies. It plays well into the pro-Russian motif that the West is collapsing, a narrative which the Kremlin employs to exercise pressure and extort European governments, whilst creating public panic over energy insecurity and high costs.In early October 2022, the European Commission outlined possible strategies to cap gas prices as the EU awaits the imminent energy crisis this winter. European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen stated that an overall cap on the price of gas could be a temporary solution, only until a new European price index ensuring better market functioning is developed. She added that the Commission is already working on capping gas prices in order to help make sure European gas supplies are not compromised.Despite recent events, and in particular the attacks on the Nord Stream Pipelines, Europe is prepared to face this winter. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated Europe’s storage volumes at approximately 88% of capacity, just a bit below the 90% the IEA considers as necessary to replace a complete halt in Russian supplies ahead of winter.See more disinformation cases on energy issues such as EU sanctions are hurting Europe more than Russia and Without Russian gas, Europe will slide into the Middle Ages.

"The article promotes a widely spread pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative that the EU is conducting open warfare against Russia.

Ukraine is recognised as a sovereign national state, with a democratically-elected president and parliament, developing within its existing boundaries to exercise the Ukrainian nation's sacrosanct right to self-determination. The country is not just a tool utilized by the West to wage a vicious proxy war against Russia. The fundamental aim of Western countries and organisations is helping Ukraine achieve a mission set out for itself: To ward off the fortified Russian invasion. Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty recently have been only violated due to systematic acts of aggression by the Kremlin’s military since 2014, peaking with a full blown military invasion of Ukraine initiated on 24 February 2022.In fact, Western leaders have been continuously calling for talks and a peaceful solution to stop Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, but Moscow has been ignoring these efforts.

Russia does not fully control the territories where so-called referendums are taking place.As stated EU High Representative Josep Borrell:“The European Union strongly condemns these planned illegal “referenda” which go against the legal and democratically elected Ukrainian authorities, are in violation of Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and in blatant breach of international law. The results of such actions will be null and void and would not be recognised by the EU and its Member States. [...]Therefore, these illegal “votes” cannot be considered under any circumstance as the free expression of the will of the people living in these regions under constant Russian military threat and intimidation"".See also this tweet by HR/VP Borrell stating that the announced annexation of Ukrainian territories by Russia is a major breach of international law and a violation of UN Charter.These parodies of democracy were also condemned by NATO, G7, US, as well as Russia’s partners like Serbia and Kazakhstan (a member of CIS and CSTO), which also mentioned that they will not recognise their results.See also a similar disinformation claims alleging that The ""referenda"" in eastern Ukraine done with the same legal norms as in France, that referendums in Donbas, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia were legal and in accordance with international law, that pro-Russian referendums in Ukraine are valid with no violations, that Donbas referendums prove that Russia respects international law, and that Kherson residents want to join Russia.

There is no evidence provided to support the claim.Sweden, Germany and Denmark have initiated investigations to find the cause of the leaks. Sweden and Denmark, in whose exclusive economic zone the accident occurred, are investigating the sites. Sweden’s authorities found evidence of detonations, thus strengthening suspicions of ""gross sabotage. However, this is only an initial step in understanding who is responsible for the sabotage. With the evidence available at the moment, any accusation is mere speculation and conspiracy theory.Russia’s accusations fit well in the often-utilised tactic of spreading as many explanations or allegations as possible, thus creating conspiracy theories surrounding a specific issue in order to muddy the waters and see what sticks. Pro-Kremlin media sharing baseless claims alleging that the leaks benefit Poland, the US or Ukraine, is similar to the Kremlin's disinformation campaign in the situation with MH-17.Regarding the Russian claims that a US helicopter might be involved in causing the leaks, the Kremlin manipulatively used FlightRadar24 information in order to provide evidence of the alleged U.S. involvement. According to FlightRadar24, at the time of the accident, the U.S. military helicopter was at least 250 km to the east from the reported area of the leaks.For a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the issue, please read Nord Stream 1 & 2 sabotage - disinformation a la MH-17?.

"A recurring anti-Western disinformation narrative claiming that the U.S. and the wider West create turmoil and dragging the South Caucasus into chaos. There is no evidence provided to support the claim. Rather the opposite: the West is a source of stabilisation and development.The U.S. has close relations with South Caucasus countries, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia. In 2021, the US - Azerbaijan trade was 517 million USD, the US - Armenia trade was 140 million USD. The US - Georgia trade was 921 million USD in 2019. In 2020, the US provided assistance in the field of democracy, economic growth, education and security to Azerbaijan (9.9 million USD) , Armenia (31.5 million USD), and to Georgia (133 million USD). During the COVID, the total assistance of the US to Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia amounted to 47.7 million USD.Additionally, the US supports peace and security in the South Caucasus region. In terms of Abkhazia and the South Ossetia, the U.S. recognises the territorial integrity of Georgia. As regards to the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, the US strongly supports efforts to pursue a lasting and sustainable political solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict through the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs and promote regional stability, peace, and prosperity.More broadly, the EU-Georgia Association Agreement entered into force in July 2016 and strives for political association and economic integration between the EU and Georgia. The EU and Georgia have also entered into a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), while Georgian citizens have benefitted from visa-free travel to the Schengen area since 28 March 2017. The EU is Georgia's largest trading partner and provides over €100 million to Georgia annually in technical and financial assistance.Since 1991, the EU has gradually become closer to Azerbaijan. It wants to build on this by deepening economic integration and increasing political cooperation with the country.The European Union and Armenia have committed themselves to work together for the benefit of the citizens of Armenia and the European Union, to contribute to the strengthening of democracy and of political, economic and institutional stability. Both sides are committed to promote, preserve and strengthen peace and stability at regional and international level and to enhance cooperation in the area of freedom, security and justice thus reinforcing the rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.See similar disinformation cases: The West sees elections in Russia as opportunity to create chaos; The US seeded chaos in Afghanistan to undermine China and Russia.

"This disinformation story is part of a wider disinformation campaign to support Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, in this case imposing the idea that aRussian victory against Ukraine is inevitable and that the risk of escalation is very high so the US should stop providing weapons and accept Russia's conditions.The fact that Russia mobilizes several hundred thousand men and threatens Ukraine and its supporters with nuclear weapons doesn’t make its victory inevitable. When this article was published Ukrainian forces just reconquered the city of Lyman in the framework of a large-scale counterattack.Western weapons being delivered to Ukraine are to allow this country to repel Russia’s brutal aggression. Peace cannot be achieved by letting an unarmed Ukraine facing a highly militarised Russia who denies its sovereignty.The unilateral lifting of sanctions will not encourage Russia to observe international laws. The EU adopted so far six sanction packages against Russia due to its illegal aggression and occupation of Ukrainian territories. Not all trades restrictions are yet enforced as the energy sector needs longer transition periods so it is too early to assess the full effect of the sanctions as that work is long term. However, it is incorrect to state that Russian economy would be barely affected or would even benefit from the sanctions. The Russian leadership is constantly demanding that the sanctions be removed.Read also related claims referenced in our database: that Western arms are supplied directly to the black market, not Ukrainian army, that by arming Ukraine, the US and the UK want to push Russia against Europe, that Western weapons are stolen long before they reach the Ukrainian soldiers, that Syrian and Libyan terrorists have been spotted in Ukraine trading Western weapons, or that Western weapons supplies to Ukraine are exacerbating the conflict. "
"All the claims in this disinformation story are false, aiming to portray the illegal annexation of Ukrainian regions by the Russian Federation as the expression of the free will of the population. In fact, those referenda don’t meet any international standard to be considered legitimate. Multiple testimonies show that many voters were coerced to take part in the false consultation, and eyewitnesses and footage in places like Enerhodar and Kherson proved that officials escorted by soldiers went door to door picking up votes. Pictures published by international outlets and agencies show that Russian soldiers were present everywhere, so the allegation that “there were no soldiers around” is a blatant lie.Not a single state in the world -including close allies of Russia such as Syria or Cuba, unlike in 2014 after Crimea’s illegal annexation- has stated its support or recognised the result of the referenda, despite Russia’s claims at the UN that the presence of over 100 observers from multiple countries recognised the outcomes as legitimate. Contrary to the claims in this disinformation story, these observers are not “independent” but sent by Moscow in a concerted effort to give cover to its pretensions of legitimacy.See other examples of similar disinformation narratives in our database, such as claims that “Referenda” in Eastern Ukraine are done with the same legal norms as in France, that Kherson residents want to join Russia in a referendum, that most people in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region identify as Russians or that the West is responsible for what happens after the Donbas referenda. "
"The claim is demonstrably false. The IAEA did not report any “Ukrainian bombing/attack” in the days before this disinformation story appeared nor after it. Although IAEA experts on the ground reported recurrent shelling in the surroundings of the plant, they didn’t attribute it to any side. As the disinformation story itself explains, the claim came from a local official appointed by the Russian occupation authorities, not from this international body (IAEA), contrary to what this manipulative headline and introductory paragraph affirm.This is part of a wider pro-Kremlin disinformation campaign about the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, trying to lay the blame on Ukraine for the dangerous situation around this facility and thus deflect any Russian responsibility. In fact, Russia has adopted many reckless actions regarding this facility, including placing military equipment and troops inside its premises, using its surroundings as a base for rocket and missile attacks, and interrupting its power line. Besides, Russia rejected UN proposals to demilitarize the areas surrounding the plant, as it was deliberately waging a fear campaign about the risks of a nuclear disaster in order to advance its goals in Ukraine.See other examples of similar disinformation narratives, such as claims that the Kyiv regime actions around the Zaporizhzhia plant is nuclear terrorism, that Washington and the Kyiv regime’s actions pose a threat of nuclear catastrophe, that Ukrainian attacks on the Zaporizhzhia plant show that the US does not accept defeat, or that NATO may use Zaporizhzhia incident as a pretext to join combat in Ukraine. "
"This disinformation story is part of a wider disinformation campaign to support Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, in this case aiming to portray Russia as as a victim and to undermine Western public support for arming Ukraine for its own defence. The Western weapons being delivered to Ukraine are intended for Ukraine to confront the military forces of Russia’s brutal aggression, so the allegation that they “will cause a terrible human suffering” is baseless.Contrary to the claim that “US and NATO launched and indirect war against Russia in Ukraine”, the fact is that Western nations did everything they could to prevent the war and have only been reacting to Russia’s full invasion. Arming Ukraine was a sovereign decision of each one of these countries, not the result of any US or NATO plot.See other examples of similar disinformation narratives in our database, such as claims that by arming Ukraine, the US and the UK want to push Russia against Europe, that Western weapons are stolen long before they reach the Ukrainian soldiers, that Syrian and Libyan terrorists have been spotted in Ukraine trading Western weapons, or that Western weapons supplies to Ukraine are exacerbating the conflict.

"The material and links may contain distressing/graphic content. Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation about the atrocities of the Ukrainian army, such as war crimes and genocide, similar to the narrative denying the involvement of Russian troops in a massacre in the town of Bucha near Kyiv. This is part of a disinformation campaign aiming to justify Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine. There is no evidence to support the claims of Ukraine creating a new ""Bucha"" in the Kharkiv region. There is no evidence presented that it is Russian soldiers in the mass graves. Additionally, the Ukrainian authorities did not systematically exterminate or abuse the people living in the conflict zone. Thedead people – military and civilian alike - are the result of a war Russia has started in Ukraine. It was not an internal civil conflict but a well-documented act of aggression by Russian armed forces, ongoing since February 2014. The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine which has closely monitored the conflict has observed no such genocide.On the contrary, there is numerous evidence that Russia is committing war crimes in Ukraine, such as the shelling of shopping malls, killing civilians, raping, as well as using unprecise weapons.In the city of Izium, in the east of Ukraine, that was recently liberated, a mass grave with more than 440 bodies was discovered. It appears that some of them were Ukrainian soldiers who took part in defending the city in March. Izium was under occupation since 1 April 2022. Numerous Ukrainian and foreign investigative organisations try to establish the reason of the deaths in each case.Preliminary results, according to Ukrainian police, show that some people were victims of a Russian airstrike on an apartment block in March, in which 47 people were killed. They also found 20 soldiers, some with their hands bound and one with a noose around his neck.See more disinformation cases, alleging that Mariupol maternity hospital shelling and Bucha massacre are fakes, that Ukraine commits wild provocations and war crimes, that Bucha is a fabrication, or that Bucha is a cover up for Ukrainian fascists torturing Russian prisoners of war.

"Pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about alleged genocide, aiming to justify the full-scale Russian invasion of and war crimes in Ukraine.The idea that Ukraine is committing genocide against its own population is promoted by the Russian president in his speeches. The idea is nevertheless, baseless. A genocide is the deliberate and systematic destruction of a group of people because of their ethnicity, nationality, religion, or race. No such plan existed in Ukraine and no killing of civilians by Ukrainian armed forces can be related to an alleged genocide.France has already supplied 18 Caesar howitzers to Ukrainian armed forces to stop Russian military invasion and will deliver 6 to 12 additional units later. Those weapons are precise and limit collateral damage.The genocide narrative has been an integral part of the pro-Kremlin justification campaign of the Russian full invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. Leaders of the European Union recognized that Moscow's actions should be evaluated as “acts of violence and the violation of international law”.Read also related stories: Russia's military operation prevented genocide in Donbas and is in full accordance with the UN charter, Armed Forces of Ukraine have committed war crimes and genocide in Donbas, The West encouraged and justified genocide against the Donbas population, Special operation aims to protect the people from the Ukrainian neo-Nazi genocide.

"Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative whose goal is to deny Russia's responsibility for growing food crisis and supply insecurity by stating that most of Ukraine's grain ships are sent to rich European countries and only 5% to the poorest. This false allegation goes in line with a wider pro-Kremlin disinformation campaign aiming to blame Western countries for a global food crisis engineered by Russia as part of its unjustified aggression against Ukraine.Russia is responsible of the global food crisis as this is a consequence of the unprovoked and unjustified Russian invasion of Ukraine: naval blockade of Ukrainian posts, bombardment of transport infrastructure and shelling of farming regions. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has destabilised global food markets and is driving food prices up due to increased cost of production, transport and freight insurance. Russia has destroyed substantial food stocks, production, as well as processing and transport capacities in Ukraine.If we look at the database of the UN Black Sea Grain Initiative, as of 23 September, out of the 203 shipments, less then half, only 92 - headed to EU countries. The majority headed for other countries like Turkey, Egypt, China, and India. Also this does not mean that these are their final destinations, as grain will be redistributed from some of these harbours to other countries.See also article 15. of the conclusions of the European Council of 20 and 21 October 2022 which states:Russia, by weaponising food in its war against Ukraine, is solely responsible for the global food security crisis it has provoked. Russia’s war of aggression has triggered disruptions of agricultural production, supply chains and trade that have driven world food and fertiliser prices to unprecedented levels. The EU-Ukraine Solidarity Lanes have made possible the export of significant volumes of Ukrainian crops, agricultural products and fertilisers to the countries most in need.See similar cases claiming that Western sanctions cause food crisis and price growth, that the food crisis has nothing to do with the Russian special operation, that Russia places no obstacles on the export of Ukrainian grain, or that EU is causing a global food shortage by keeping all the grain from Ukraine.

"Multiple disinformation narratives from pro-Kremlin outlets accusing the West of anti-Russian policies, colonialism, lack of democracy, aggressive Russophobia and allegedly belligerent and hostile agenda to contain, weaken and ruin Russia, aiming to portray Russia as a victim and deflect any responsibility for Moscow’s illicit actions.Before Russia launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, Kyiv and Western nations had been trying to conduct a dialogue with Russia on all disputed issues, including security guarantees. Russia cut short all attempts at achieving a compromise over security guarantees by attacking Ukraine.The West or the US are not in war with Russia or Russians. Since Russia launched its unjustified aggression against Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the West has been calling for Russian withdrawal from Ukraine and a peaceful settlement.Western governments have reacted to the actions of the Kremlin undermining international stability and security, such as illegal annexation of Crimea, the downing of flight MH17, interference in the US as well as in European electoral processes, poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the UK. The Kremlin has also been criticised and sanctioned for specific domestic policies that violate human rights in Russia, such as the poisoning of the opposition politician Alexei Navalny. Sanctions were implemented by the European Union as a reaction to the unjustified actions of Russia.The current deterioration in relations between the West and Moscow is the consequence of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine. Judging by statements from some Russian politicians, lately confirmed by Putin's longspeech 30 September announcing annexation of four more regions of Ukraine,it is Moscow who has hostile intentions against the West and makes no secret about it, while the West is compelled to deter such Russian actions. It is Russia who is waging a hybrid war, fusing soft and hard power to achieve Russia’s ends with both political and military means.Read our recent article: Putin scaremongering – a Quick Guide.See the EU's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine here along with EU vs Disinfo's Guide to Deciphering Pro-Kremlin disinformation around Putin's War.

"Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative claiming Ukraine is a „Nazi” country, that is controlled by NATO.Ukraine is not a proxy for any foreign government or organisation. Ukraine is a sovereign and independent state with a democratically-elected president and parliament. Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity have been only violated as a result of continuous acts of aggression by the Russian armed forces since 2014, culminating with a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine starting on 24 February 2022.The US, the EU and some NATO member states provide Ukraine with military assistance to repel the unprovoked Russian aggression, but they are not involved in fighting. Ukraine receives weapons with the sole aim of restoring its territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders. Western instructors are teaching Ukrainian soldiers how to use modern weaponry, but there are no Western troops fighting on the front. NATO as an organisation is not involved in war in Ukraine.As for the claim that Russia is fighting against Nazi/ Bandera Ukraine: One of the Kremlin’s most common disinformation narratives to justify its devastating war against Ukraine is the lie that Russia is pursuing the “denazification” of Ukraine. In reality, Ukraine is not a Nazi state, does not have a Nazi ruling elite and Nazism is not Ukraine’s ideology. For further debunk read here.Related to nuclear weapons: under the Budapest memorandum in 1994, Ukraine promised to remove all Soviet-era nuclear weapons from its territory, send them to disarmament facilities in Russia, and sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Ukraine kept these promises. In return, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States promised that none of them would ever threaten or use force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine.

This narrative plays into the Kremlin's claims that the West is collapsing. The Kremlin seeks to pressure and blackmail European governments and create public panic over energy insecurity / energy costs.The EU will not become de-industrialised because of high energy prices caused by Russia's decision to cut gas supplies to Europe.Despite the Kremlin's decision to limit gas supplies to Europe and the effects of Russia's unprovoked aggression against Ukraine, the EU economy is recovering from the crisis created by COVID-19. For instance, a growth rate of 2.6% for 2022 is expected in the recent forecast published by the European Commission. Inflation is assumed to reach 7.6% on average.Eurostat, the statistical office of the EU, indicates that, in the 2nd quarter of 2022, GDP in the Eurozone was up by 0.8%, employment increased by 0.4%. Compared with the same quarter of the previous year, seasonally adjusted GDP increased by 4.1% in the euro area and by 4.2% in the EU in the second quarter of 2022. The European Investment Bank estimates that real economic growth in 2022 will be below 3%, which is just 1% below the forecast at the beginning of the year. It also stresses that EU Member States will have to deal with rising prices for households and industry, trade disruptions, etc. Nevertheless, the EU is in a good position to avoid recession and economic downturn. So far, the EU adopted so far six sanction packages against Russia due to its illegal aggression and occupation of Ukrainian territories. Not all trade restrictions are enforced yet as the energy sector needs longer transition periods. So it is too early to assess the full effect of the sanctions. However, it is incorrect to state that the Russian economy will be barely affected or would even benefit from the sanctions. The Russian leadership is constantly demanding the sanctions be removed.See similar disinformation cases alleging that Europe is collapsing: EU sanctions are hurting Europe more than Russia; sanctions imposed by Washington and Brussels are pushing Italy to economic suicide; Western sanctions are the cause of inflation."
"The article promotes a pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative addressing the invasion of Ukraine, aiming to justify Putin’s blatant disregard of international law, while trying to discredit the collective West’s efforts to safeguard fundamental freedoms and human rights of the people living in the occupied areas under constant Russian military threat.The referenda held by the Kremlin directly violated the Constitution of Ukraine. The latter states that the procedure and organisation for conducting referenda are “determined exclusively by the laws of Ukraine” (Article 92). Putin’s referenda are staged to imitate a genuine plebiscite and a deceptive pursuit of self-determination of Ukrainians living in the occupied regions. In reality, the referenda will serve as Putin’s prelude to the annexation of these regions and have the potential to drastically escalate the war.See the response from the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell in which he stated that the annexation votes will be denounced as illegal by the EU. He clarified that Putin’s intentions to annex territories occupied by force since February 2022 and to hold sham referenda will not change their legal status, and they will be internationally recognised as integral territories of Ukraine.Such referenda are considered illegitimate by Ukrainian and international law. Article 4 of the UN Charter reads:""All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.""UN Secretary-General António Guterres strongly condemned Russia annexation plans saying, “The Charter is clear. Any annexation of a State’s territory by another State resulting from the threat or use of force is a violation of the Principles of the UN Charter and international law… Any decision to proceed with the annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine would have no legal value and deserves to be condemned”.Find other articles promoting disinformation narratives on the annexation and referendums in Ukraine, such as Luhansk and Donetsk declared referendum after referendum, Crimea joined Russia after the bloody US-coup in Ukraine, or Kherson residents want to join Russia, not Ukraine.

"Pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative on the invasion of Ukraine and sham referenda on occupied Ukrainian territories aiming at justifying the annexation of Ukrainian territories.Russia has held illegal referendums on four occupied oblasts of Ukraine (Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson) on September 23-26. In each case, Russia does not fully control the territories where so-called referendums are taking place. As stated EU High Representative Josep Borrell:“The European Union strongly condemns these planned illegal “referenda” which go against the legal and democratically elected Ukrainian authorities, are in violation of Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and in blatant breach of international law. The results of such actions will be null and void and would not be recognised by the EU and its Member States.Since the start of the invasion Russia has intimidated, illegally detained, tortured and abducted Ukrainian citizens and a significant part of the original population in the invaded areas has been forced to flee. Legally elected local officials have, in some cases, been forcibly replaced. Access to the internet, free and independent media and freedom of expression have also been greatly restricted.Therefore, these illegal “votes” cannot be considered under any circumstance as the free expression of the will of the people living in these regions under constant Russian military threat and intimidation"".These parodies of democracy were also condemned by NATO, G7, US, as well as Russia’ partners like Serbia and Kazakhstan (a member of CIS and CSTO), which also mentioned that they will not recognise their results.See also a similar disinformation claims alleging that Kherson residents want to join Russia in a referendum.

"The target of this piece of disinformation, built around the claim of elections in some EU countries, is the President of the European Commission (EC) Ursula von der Leyen. The piece deliberately misconstrues a statement of the EC President in order to promote the disinformation narrative of an EU which infringes upon the national sovereignty of its member states and also euroscepticism. The President of the European Commission has not threatened the “people of Italy, Hungary and Poland”. It was a message for the governments of Hungary and Poland, and the upcoming government of Italy to respect democratic principles.This is not the first time that Ursula von der Leyen is the target for pro-Kremlin disinformation. See some other cases: Ursula von der Leyen unilaterally banned independent media; President of the European Commission and head of NATO visit Vilnius to instruct authorities; Ursula von der Leyen shouldn’t decide on the safety of Sputnik V; EU’s approval process is politicised.These examples of disinformation fit in the Kremlin strategy of promoting the false narrative of lost sovereignty."

In August 2005, the US and Ukrainian governments made an agreement to prevent the spread of dangerous pathogens and relevant expertise and to diminish potential biological risks. Partially, this agreement was aimed at modernising state laboratories in Odesa, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk and other regions, consisting of upgrading lab equipment and repairs of premises.

Russian and other languages of national minorities can be freely used in private communication, religious ceremonies, book publishing, the media, and education.Ukraine is not a Russophobic, anti-Russian country. The relations between the countries worsened after Russia occupied Crimea in 2014. Russia has also been involved in the destabilisation of eastern Ukraine, the creation of DNR and LNR, the supply of personnel and weapons. The destabilisation of Eastern Ukraine and the illegal annexation of Crimea have been condemned by the Council of the European Union and led to restrictive measures since 2014.The September 2022 sham referenda have no relation whatsoever with the unimpeachable right for self-determination, the human rights and rule of law. This is a mere cargo cult imitation of the forms of democratic procedures while the very fundamentals of rule of laws are denied. Those procedures will not change the legal status of those territories. As stated High Representative Josep Borrell : The intention to annex territories occupied by force since February 2022 and to hold sham referenda will not change their legal status. They are and they will remain internationally recognised as an integral part of Ukraine.

Contrary to what this disinformation story affirms, not only Ukrainian soldiers but also multiple civilians were summarily executed, in many cases after horrible tortures, and then buried sometimes in mass graves.A similar pattern has been observed in other areas under Russian occupation. On 23 September, the UN Commission of Inquiry for Ukraine presented its conclusions showing that the Russian Federation has committed multiple war crimes throughout the invasion, after research carried out in four regions: Kyiv, Kharkiv, Sumy and Chernihiv.The European Union is supporting the International Criminal Court in the ongoing investigations into war crimes committed by Russian forces in Ukraine.

The claim also builds on the Kremlin narrative of the West encircling Russia and advancing again the narrative about Nazi Ukraine.Russia’s drive to mobilize new soldiers and to stage illegal “referendums” in four occupied regions of Ukraine mark a sharp escalation by President Vladimir Putin, as he tries to hold the line despite multiple failures in his ongoing invasion, including a major retreat in the Kharkiv region in September 2022. Moreover, according to the Institute for the Study of War assessment, Russia is likely underging a full-scale mobilisation, because with ""partial"" mobilisation is unlikely to transform the war in Russia's favour.The West, the US or NATO did not declare war on Russia and are not in war with Russia or Russians. Since Russia launched its unjustified aggression against Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the West has been calling for Russian withdrawal from Ukraine and a peaceful settlement.The US, the EU and NATO condemn in the strongest possible terms Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which is entirely unjustified and unprovoked.The US, the EU and some NATO member states provide Ukraine with military assistance to repel the unprovoked Russian aggression, but they are not involved in fighting.

"This article is part of the pro-Kremlin disinformation ecosystem's attempt to justify Russia’s occupation in parts of Ukraine via illegitimate referenda and to distract from the war crimes committed by Russian invaders in the now-liberated territories of Ukraine. It offers an absurd interpretation of the Russian military invasion of Ukraine with the use of the classic disinformation narrative about the Russian world.Further, the claim rejects the right of Ukraine to exist as a sovereign state and speaks of the Russo-Ukrainian war as part of Russian history and the “reunification”.Russia's unjustified military invasion of Ukraine is a clear violation of international law. The Ukrainian Army and volunteers are fighting with Russian troops to defend their country from unprovoked Russian military aggression. Russian President Putin launched a new, full-scale invasion, what he called a ""special military operation"" against Ukraine on 24 February 2022 citing NATO’s military infrastructure approaching the Russian border as a pretext. Another pretext for the so-called operation is the “demilitarisation and denazification” of Ukraine according to official Russian statements. The invasion was followed by airstrikes on military objects. Russian troops soon after started bombing and shelling civilian targets as well.The referendums are shams, conducted in haste and under military repressionand as far from the ""public will of the people"" as imaginable. Ukraine is a well-defined nation-state with a long history and its own literature and identity, despite foreign rule for long periods of time. Ukrainians and Russians belong to the Slavs ethnolinguistic group but they are not a single nation.

OSCE condemned the sentencing of OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM) mission members Maxim Petrov and Dmytro Shabanov as a result of so-called “legal proceedings” and called for the immediate release of all three OSCE mission members in detention.The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM) was deployed on 21 March 2014, following a request to the OSCE by Ukraine’s government and a consensus decision by all 57 OSCE participating States. The SMM was an unarmed, civilian mission, present on the ground 24/7 in all regions of Ukraine. Since its deployment in March 2014, the Mission issued 2432 daily reports and 242 spot reports. SMM officials issued reports on a daily basis about the current situation in the war zone. One of the SMM’s main tasks was to observe and report in an impartial and objective way on the situation in Ukraine, and to facilitate dialogue among all parties to the crisis.The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission mandate expired on 31 March 2022. No consensus was reached on the extension of the mandate. Russia blocks mandate extension of OSCE monitoring mission to Ukraine.See other examples of disinformation narratives about the supposed anti-Russian bias of international institutions- such as the OPCW, the World Anti-Doping Agency or the United Nations, which always falsely accuse Russia-, about the alleged Russophobia of the EU, and about the West which has turned a blind eye to the genocide in Ukraine.

"The material and links may contain distressing/ graphic content.Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation about the atrocities of the Ukrainian army, such as war crimes and genocide. Similar to the narrative denying the involvement of Russian troops in a massacre in the town of Bucha near Kyiv. This is part of a disinformation campaign aiming to justify Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine. There is no evidence to support the claims of genocide by Ukraine. The Ukrainian authorities did not systematically exterminate or abuse the people living in the conflict zone. The claimed dead people – military and civilian alike - are a result of a war Russia had started in Ukraine. It was not an internal civil conflict but a well-documented act of aggression by Russian armed forces, ongoing since February 2014. The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine which has closely monitored the conflict has observed no such genocide.On the contrary, there is numerous evidence that Russia is committing war crimes in Ukraine, such as the shelling of shopping malls, killing civilians, raping, as well as using unprecise weapons.In the city of Izium, in the east of Ukraine, that was recently liberated, a massgrave with more than 440 bodies was discovered. It appears that some of them were Ukrainian soldiers who took part in defending the city in March. Izium was under occupation since 1 April 2022.Numerous Ukrainian and foreign investigative organisation try to establish the reason of deaths in each case. Preliminary results, according to Ukrainian police, show that some people were victims of a Russian airstrike on an apartment block in March, in which 47 people were killed. They also found 20 soldiers, some with their hands bound and one with a noose around his neck.High Representative Josep Borrell stated that ""the EU is deeply shocked by mass graves discovered by Ukrainian authorities.""""Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine has been leaving a trail of blood and destruction across Ukraine.

"The article promotes two recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives. The first one claims that the ongoing war in Ukraine is definitely being won by the Russian side, whilst the situation for Ukrainian troops is gradually deteriorating. The other argues that the collective West is lying to its citizens about the tragedy that Ukraine endures every day in order to pursue the selfish goals of the EU and UN.In the last two weeks, the Ukrainian army's careful planning and astute use of Western military resources led to a successful counter-offensive that resulted in the liberation of nearly 3,000 square kilometers of Russian occupied areas. The recent recapture of the Ukrainian territories is by far the Ukrainian military's biggest achievement, since they pushed the Russian troops back from the capital Kyiv in March.The latter counter-offensive maneuvers have not only pushed Russian troops out of the Kharkiv region but are now also threatening to retake territories Putin's troops seized in the Donbas — the eastern industrial heartland whose ""freedom"" the Kremlin has pinpointed as the main goal of the ""special military operation"". If Russia starts losing key territories that they have recently gained in the Donbas region, it would be virtually impossible to hide Kremlin’s ensuing military and political failure.Regarding the fact that Putin just recently made nuclear threats and initiated a partial mobilisation, the latter can be viewed as a clear indicator that the war is not going according to his plan. Thus, any claims from the Kremlin that the West is sugarcoating the situation in Ukraine are and will become easily refutable.See similar cases of disinformation representing the war in Ukraine in a false manner: Russia is winning against the Ukrainian Nazis and the West is doomed and Ukrainian forces fired missiles at the Zaporizhzhia station and Russian defenses repels them.

Although it is true that the US has been sharing intelligence with Ukrainian authorities throughout the war to repeal Russia’s unprovoked aggression, the allegation that the US or Ukraine are deliberately trying to cause damage to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is false. In fact, both countries have made repeated efforts to defuse tension around the plant, whilst Russia has adopted many reckless actions regarding this facility, including placing military equipment and troops inside its premises, using its surroundings as a base for rocket and missile attacks, and interrupting its power line. Besides, Russia rejected UN proposals to demilitarise the areas surrounding the plant, as it was deliberately waging a fear campaign about the risks of a nuclear disaster in order to advance its goals in Ukraine.See other examples of similar disinformation narratives, such as claims that the Kyiv regime actions around the Zaporizhzhia plant is nuclear terrorism, that Washington and the Kyiv regime’s actions pose a threat of nuclear catastrophe, that Ukrainian attacks on the Zaporizhzhia plant show that the US does not accept defeat, or that NATO may use Zaporizhzhia incident as a pretext to join combat in Ukraine.

According to a recent research, 18 per cent of Ukrainian citizens speak Russian in everyday life, mostly in the East and the South. The fact that Russian can be heard among Ukrainian servicemen on the frontline more often than elsewhere in Ukraine can be explained by a big number of local residents who join the army as volunteers and enroll in local militias of their own free will. It has nothing to do with ethnic cleansing, as Russian propagandists often claim.There are also tens of thousands of Ukrainian citizens who are ethnic Crimean Tatars, Jews, Hungarians, Romanians, Greeks and Bulgarians, Roma and others. Many of them speak their respective languages, Ukrainian and Russian.Ukraine is not a Nazi country and its leaders do not intent to build a monoethnic state. Neither ethnic minorities nor Russian-speaking Ukrainians are persecuted in Ukraine. President Vladimir Zelensky was brought up in a Russian-speaking family. Ukrainian law does not forbid the use of Russian nor any other languages in private communication and religious ceremonies, as well as in book publishing, the press, including radio and television, education and the service sector. Furthermore, Ukraine is a signatory to the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, which guarantees that people in Ukraine have the right: ""to use freely and without interference his or her minority language, in private and in public, orally and in writing"".

Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity have been violated by continuous acts of aggression by Russian armed forces since 2014 and culminated in an aggressive attack on a neighbouring country on February 24, 2022.In fact, the aid that the EU and the USA give to Ukraine is specifically to help it preserve its territorial integrity and sovereignty and does not contain territorial or other conditions that would affect the status of an independent and sovereign country. This is reflected in several European documents developed after the beginning of the Russian aggression against Ukraine. Most recently, the Declaration by the High Representative on behalf of the EU on the imposition of additional restrictive measures on the Russian Federation in reaction to its actions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. Also, the decision of the European Council, issued on June 2022 on the membership application of certain countries, stated: „The European Union remains strongly committed to providing further military support to help Ukraine exercise its inherent right of self-defence against the Russian aggression and defend its territorial integrity and sovereignty”.See here a case claiming the West is seeking to create joint Polish-Ukrainian state and here a case on how the US and the EU made Ukraine dependent on the West.

"The article utilizes a popular pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative, claiming that the energy crisis in Europe (and Germany in particular) was caused by the US and the EU themselves. This narrative is deployed in tandem with Russia’s claims that the European Union will inevitably disintegrate. In reality, the Kremlin is attempting to extort EU governments and create widespread public panic over energy cost and insecurity.There is no evidence to support the claim that the German government is deliberately neglecting the energy security of its citizens. In fact, EU member states have undertaken multiple counter-measures in order to increase EU security of energy supply, such as the ""Save gas for a safe winter"" plan which consists of voluntary reduction of natural gas demand by 15%. The European Council regulation also foresees the possibility to trigger a global EU alert on security of energy resources, which will result in the gas demand reduction becoming mandatory. The purpose of the latter is to make savings ahead of winter in order to prepare for possible disruptions of gas supplies from Russia – something the Kremlin is continuously utilising as a tool for blackmailing the West.Some countries have alternative supply options. Even though the global gas market was negatively influenced by Russia’s actions even before the invasion, Europe’s gas network infrastructure is well developed, meaning energy supplies can be shared to countries in dire need this winter as an act of solidarity. Despite the recent cut of Russian gas flows via the Nord Stream I pipeline, the EU is ready for the winter ahead. During recent discussions between EU Energy Ministers it became clear that EU underground gas storаges have been filled by 82.5% of their capacity, well ahead of the 1 November deadline set for achieving the 80% goal. As such, the EU has taken concrete actions to prepare for further disruptions to energy supply from Russia in the coming winter. More cases concerning European energy issues include: Germany doesn’t want energy solidarity but vassalage; Sofia will have to buy Russian gas in rubbles; Without Russian gas, Europe will slide into the Middle Ages.

"This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative, striving to convince readers that NATO’s support to the Ukrainian military campaign is the reason for the war in the first place and leaves Russia no other option but to defend itself. In reality, this is an attempt to justify Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and shift responsibility for the war to the collective West.NATO and Western nations are sending weapons to Ukraine with the explicit aim of helping the country to drive off Russia's aggression. Western military support intends to assist Ukraine in its battle to liberate its territories and recover its territorial integrity within the country’s internationally recognised borders. Ukraine has never demonstrated any intention of advancing into Russia’s officially established borders, thus there is no justification to Russia’s claims of self-defence.Furthermore, Russia’s military escalations against Ukraine are without any basis in international law. The Russian “special military operation"" is merely the continuation of the illegal use of force against Ukraine that started in 2014. Although the Minsk agreements and ensuing ceasefires may have temporarily suspended hostilities before, Ukraine’s right of self-defense remained unaltered.Read similar cases in our database, claiming that NATO is interested in further military escalation, the West prolongs the war in Ukraine by providing the country with arms and political support and that the European Union continues to promote and invest in further hostilities.

"Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation about the atrocities of the Ukrainian army in Donbas, such as war crimes and genocide. This is part of a disinformation campaign aiming to deflect attantion away from Russian actions and justify Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine.There is no evidence to support the claims of genocide by Ukraine. The Ukrainian authorities did not systematically exterminate or abuse the people living in the conflict zone. The claimed dead people – military and civilian alike - are a result of a war Russia had started in Ukraine.

There is documented evidence that, for instance, the shooting of civilians in Bucha was done by Russian troops. Several executions and shootings of Ukrainian civilians in Bucha were recorded on video by witnesses and Ukrainian drones. Satellite images show that some of the corpses were already lying on the streets weeks before the Russian withdrawal.

With this manipulation Russia aims to manipulate the energy markets in Europe and thus raise the price of natural gas.The Kremlin finally showed its cards when spokesperson Dmitry Peskov admitted that Russia’s gas supplies to the EU have been and will stay on hold not because of supposed maintenance of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, but because gas is a tool of political blackmail in the Kremlin’s toolbox of influence. The Kremlin seeks to pressure the European governments and create public panic over energy insecurity / energy costs.Russia has been using energy as a political and economic weapon several times against other states. Russia is no longer a stable and reliable supplier and while Europe is indeed facing an energy crisis with diversification to other sources, it is still set to grow this year according to the European Commission's summer 2022 forecast, while Russia's economy is set to contract by 6% in 2022.The European Commission proposed gas price caps would be used to maximize gas prices at a manageable level and prevent further use of the so-called energy weapon by the Russian regime.See the EU's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine here along with EU vs Disinfo's Guide to Deciphering Pro-Kremlin disinformation around Putin's War.See other examples of similar disinformation messages, such as claims that Operating Nord Stream I would be dangerous, The West caused a global economic storm - energy crisis, Western Global Elites Chose To Plunge Their Countries Into Poverty And Dictatorship To Retain Power, or that The West Is Blinded By Its Desire To Destroy Russia.

Actually, crosses of various forms and shapes are very widespread symbols in Christian nations all over the world. They can be found during religious ceremonies, on national flags and coats of arms, and in other spheres of life. No wonder that some of these crosses can resemble each other.Ukraine is not a Nazi states, nor is Nazism its official ideology. A ban on Nazi and Communist ideologies was issued there In 2015. As in any other society, there are people of right-wing views in Ukraine. But far-right groups enjoyed a very limited presence during the Euromaidan and had poor results in the 2014 presidential and parliamentary elections. The ""Right Sector"" candidate received 0.7% of the vote in the May 2014 presidential elections, and the party received 1.8% of the vote in the October 2014 parliamentary elections.

Secondly, the life, statements, public service and the overall track-record of Mr Borrell shows very clearly which side he is on - he always opposed Franco's regime, defended democracy and human rights. He has been and remains a member of the socialist party and was an active protagonist in the Spanish transition to democracy. Any statement suggesting otherwise is just defamatory and shows lack of knowledge of facts that are widely accessible.Taking words out of context and twisting them blaming Ukraine, EU, UK etc. of being “fascist” is a quintessential tactic of the pro-Kremlin disinformation ecosystems where everybody who disagree with Russia may be qualified as fascist.See more disinformation cases on Fascist sanctions of EU, EU helping to train Nazis etc. "

Russia’s own counter-sanctions have also had a clear negative effect on the welfare of the average Russian household.A report written by the Chief Economist of Confindustria, the General Confederation of Italian Industry, published in Spring 2022, states that the direct impact of sanctions on Russia on the Italian economy is overall modest.Read similar cases claiming that the EU lost more from sanctions than Russia and that the US is pushing Europe into the abyss.

"Pro-Kremlin disinformation about the invasion of Ukraine and the EU's support for Ukraine, alleging that there is no support among the citizens for the EU's actions. Recent EU polls show that the majority of EU citizens support the EU's response to Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine. All EU actions receive majority support: humanitarian support (92%), welcoming in the EU Ukrainians fleeing the war (90%), financing of supply and delivery of military equipment to Ukraine (68%). The absolute majority of EU citizens are satisfied with the EU's response to Russia's aggression (57%). When asked whether national governments are doing enough or too much to help refugees fleeing Ukraine, most EU citizens say that their governments are either doing enough (33-53% depending on the country) or not enough (13-39%). Only between 9% in Spain and 27% in Poland believe that their governments invest too much in helping refugees from Ukraine. Also, when asked about sending military equipment to Ukraine, the majority of EU citizens in Poland, Spain, France, and Germany believe that additional military assistance to Ukraine must be provided.

This claim was made to justify Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine.""Nazi"" is also a classic Kremlin manipulative accusation against everybody not supporting Russia. See our article ""Nazi East, Nazi West, Nazi over the cuckoo´s nest"" Russia's aggression against Ukraine was unprovoked and unjustified. Contrary to Russian claims, the Russian language is not banned in Ukraine, nor did Ukraine commit genocide in the non-government controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. None of the multiple reports on the human rights situation in Ukraine, which are regularly published by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, or the reports of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission come even close to referencing genocide in Ukraine.Russia is not protecting ethnic Russians or Ukrainians speaking Russian in Ukraine. Such claims have been unequivocally debunked by independent Russian media, among others. Ukrainian law does not forbid the use of Russian nor any other languages in private communication and religious ceremonies, as well as in book publishing, the press, including radio and television, education and the service sector. Furthermore, Ukraine is a signatory to the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, which guarantees that people in Ukraine have the right: ""to use freely and without interference his or her minority language, in private and in public, orally and in writing.""The myth of Nazi-ruled Ukraine, which appeared during the Revolution of Dignity (Euromaidan) protests in late 2013 - early 2014, has been used by the Kremlin to discredit Kyiv’s shift toward Euro-Atlantic policy. It has also been widely debunked and analysed by EUvsDisinfo. Russia has aggressive plans beyond Ukraine. Some Russian politicians seem to be using the words de-Nazification indiscriminately of late. In response to a critical remark by Polish President Andrzej Duda about Russia, Russian MP Oleg Morozov threatened in May 2022 to place Poland “in the first place in line for de-Nazification after Ukraine”.Read more disinformation cases alleging that Ukraine is a Nazi state, the EU is Hitler's 'New Europe', and the European Union justifies Nazism.

"The claim is demonstrably false. According to information from the United Nations (archived here) on 08 September 2022 - one day after this disinformation allegation was made - the actual number of ships carrying Ukrainian grain under the UN-backed Black Sea Grain Initiative was 103, although the destination of one was still undecided. The far majority, 68% went to countries outside the EU.39 ships going to Turkey, 8 to Egypt, 4 to Israel, 3 to South Korea, 3 to China, 3 to India, 2 to Lebanon, 2 to Iran, 1 to Sudan, 1 to Djibouti, 1 to Yemen, 1 to Kenya and 1 to Somalia.33 ships had gone or were headed to EU countries, Besides, this doesn’t mean that these are their final destinations, as grain will be redistributed from some of these harbours to other countries.This false allegation goes in line with a wider pro-Kremlin disinformation campaign aiming to blame Western countries for a global food crisis engineered by Russia as part of its unjustified aggression against Ukraine. See other similar disinformation narratives in our database, such as claims that Western sanctions cause food crisis and price growth, that the food crisis has nothing to do with the Russian special operation, that Russia places no obstacles on the export of Ukrainian grain, or that Kyiv burned grains in Mariupol and mined the Black Sea to prevent its exportation.

Though, this high level of a corruption is a concern for foreign aid and reforms to reduce it are made in the exceptional full scale war situation. The Association Council between the EU and Ukraine stated for instance on 5 September 2022:""The Association Council welcomed the steps that Ukraine had taken thus far with regard to reforms in the sphere of anti-corruption, fighting against fraud, anti-money laundering and rule of law and urged Ukraine to pursue further efforts in these areas. It stressed the paramount importance of ensuring the independence, effectiveness and sustainability of the anti-corruption institutional framework and avoid politisation of the work of all law enforcement agencies. The Association Council welcomed the major steps taken by Ukraine towards a comprehensive reform of the judiciary in 2021 and the appointment of the new Head of the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office, while emphasising the urgent need to complete the selection of the new Director of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine and the reform of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine (CCU), including a clear and transparent competitive selection process for judges.""The effects of sanctions on the Russian economy are real and long term.

"Recurrent pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative claiming that the Ukrainian language does not exist, with an injunction to “purify” it to make it sound like Russian.Ukrainian is a real language and very different from Russian since centuries. It is more similar to other Slavic languages than Russian. In the last period of the USSR 1950s-1980s there was an effort to make the language disappear by progressively replacing words by Russian words. Russian was considered having an historical perspective in Soviet Union but not Ukrainian as Natalya Shevchenko explains:During the “thaw,” a period when Ukrainian publishing underwent a significant revival, the Ukrainian language was nevertheless classified with most languages of the USSR as “non-perspective.” A few languages other than Russian were counted as “perspective”: Armenian, Georgian, Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian. Both their linguistic nature and the national solidarity attached to them meant these languages resisted Russification well; Ukrainian and Belarusian kinship with Russian condemned both languages to gradual destruction.To know more about the Kremlin efforts to pretend against reality that Ukrainian was a dialect understood by Russian watch this video.

"The article transmits recurring disinformation narratives about the alleged technical issues that limit natural gas deliveries to the EU through the Nord Stream pipeline. This narrative plays into the Kremlin's claims that the West is collapsing.Siemens noted that it did not believe such leakage is sufficient ground to stop the pipeline's operation, as ""Such leaks do not normally affect the operation of a turbine and can be sealed on site."" The so-called technical problems occur at the same time as Kremlin seeks to pressure the European governments and create public panic over energy insecurity / energy costs."
"This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about sanctions in the context of the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin has long claimed that Western sanctions backfired. The claim was neither counterbalanced nor critically challenged in the article. Russia has been using energy as a political and economic weapon several times against other states. Russia is no longer a stable and reliable supplier and while Europe is indeed facing an energy crisis with diversification to other sources, it is still set to grow this year according to the European Commission's summer 2022 forecast, while Russia's economy is set to contract by 6% in 2022. A Russian internal report assessed that the sanctions might set the country back substantially, especially sectors that the Russian economy have relied on in the past, such as the oil, gas, metals sectors, as well as chemicals and wood products. Massive international disvestment, braindrain and logistical bottleneck are visible. Crucially, Russia is having significant issues acquiring high-tech chips that are required for its precise weaponry, so it needs to use older stock of Soviet weapons."

"This article contains a recurrent pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative, claiming that through weapon shipments and military support, the West is obliging Ukraine to take aggressive steps in a war that it cannot win.In reality, the EU, NATO and their partners have continuously lobbied for a peaceful and diplomatic resolution for all issues caused by Russia’s aggressive foreign policy. In reality, the West dispatches weapons to Ukraine in order to stop Russia’s aggression and killings of civilians, whilst still putting an effort into finding a diplomatic solution. Ukraine’s armed forces are most certainly not in a helpless state, as the Kremlin’s propaganda claims. On the contrary, Ukraine is pushing back and showing resistance, which is important from a political, psychological and military viewpoint. Although Russia has occupied approximately 20% of Ukraine (where it is committing war crimes against civilians), Ukraine’s military has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to counter Russia’s strategy and tactics and capacity to wage counter-offensives. Ukrainian armed forces have successfully attacked munition depots and various strategic targets behind the frontline and have started a counter-offensive in the south, especially around Kherson as well as a counter-offensive in the east in the Kharkiv region.More cases concerning NATO/EU enlargement and military support to Ukraine include: By arming Ukraine, the US and the UK want to push Russia against Europe; NATO is interested in further military escalation; Russia's special operation in Ukraine is due to NATO's persistent expansion.

"The article promotes a recurrent pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about biological weapons being secretly developed by the US in countries bordering Russia. This narrative is a leitmotif in a years-old disinformation campaign conducted by the Kremlin and is currently deployed in an attempt to justify Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.Some of the most bizarre and yet enduring Kremlin disinformation narratives have been those accusing the West of running clandestine biological research programmes to wreak havoc around the world. In reality, all laboratories located in Ukraine are controlled by the Ukrainian government. In August 2005, the US and Ukrainian governments made an agreement to prevent the spread of dangerous pathogens and relevant expertise and to diminish potential biological risks. Partially, this agreement was aimed at modernising state laboratories in Odesa, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk and other regions, consisting of upgrading lab equipment and repairs of premises.The US Embassy in Ukraine previously addressed the claims about supposed bio-military labs in Ukraine, stating that this is a fabricated accusation in pro-Kremlin propaganda that aims to hinder the ongoing U.S.-Ukrainian partnership to reduce biological threats. The accusations are part of the Kremlin’s broader, long-lasting disinformation campaign to discredit the US in the eyes of Putin’s pro-Western neighbors such as Georgia and Ukraine.More cases concerning bio-military labs near Russia’s border include: Ukraine disease outbreaks linked to activity of US biolabs; Germany was involved in the development of biological weapons in Ukraine; Bio experiments in US labs turn Ukrainian soldiers into ‘most cruel monsters’.

"Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about an aggressive West encircling and destabilising Russia, aiming to portray the country as a victim and deflect any responsibility for Moscow’s illicit actions. In fact, Western actions adopted against Russia, such as sanctions or diplomatic measures, are a reaction to these actions including the illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula, the long-term destabilisation of Ukraine or the unprovoked and unjustified invasion of this peaceful country.See other examples of similar disinformation messages, such as claims that the West fights Russia through psy-ops like Bucha and the Mariupol maternity hospital, that the US needs war between Russia and Ukraine to weaken Russia, that Moscow called for peaceful coexistence but Russia is depicted as a global threat, or that the West has an anti-Russian plan named “Anaconda ring”. "
"The allegation is false. By trying to blame Western powers, this disinformation story aims to deflect any Russian responsibility for the dangerous situation around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Contrary to what this disinformation story claims, the US and NATO have been actively calling at every point for a reduction of tensions and risks regarding the plant. The US backed UN proposals for a diplomatic solution to this situation such as the creation of a demilitarised area around Zaporizhzhia (which Moscow rejected), while NATO pushed for a IAEA inspection of the plant.In fact, Russia has taken many reckless actions regarding this facility, including placing military equipment and troops inside its premises, using its surroundings as a base for rocket and missile attacks, and interrupting its power line. Besides, Russia has deliberately promoted a fear campaign about the risks of a nuclear disaster in order to advance its goals in Ukraine.See other examples of similar disinformation narratives, such as claims that the Kyiv regime actions around the Zaporizhzhia plant is nuclear terrorism, that Washington and the Kyiv regime’s actions pose a threat of nuclear catastrophe, that Ukrainian attacks on the Zaporizhzhia plant show that the US does not accept defeat, or that NATO may use Zaporizhzhia incident as a pretext to join combat in Ukraine.

"The claim is a deliberate manipulation of the original Bloomberg article. Although part of this Sputnik story contains accurate reporting on a joint non-paper obtained by Bloomberg and titled “Defending the international order in an age of systemic rivalry: EU-Russia relations”, it includes a crucial distortion in the headline and the initial paragraphs. The original article states: “Germany and France want the European Union to drive a wedge between President Vladimir Putin and the Russian people with a campaign to counter propaganda within Russia”, which is very different from the allegation made by this disinformation story about “a Western propaganda campaign in Russia”. Through this distortion, Sputnik tries to equate Russian disinformation with the efforts to counter it, while promoting other long-term pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about Western initiatives to destabilise Russia.Distorting articles in Western media to make them appear as supporting pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives is a frequent technique of pro-Kremlin outlets. See other examples in our database, such as false claims that Financial Times reported that Ukraine threatened Russia with terrorist attacks, that The New York Times reports that Russia is barely affected by sanctions, that Germany doesn’t trust Zelenskyy according to Der Spiegel, that The National Interest explained why the US should side with Russia in Ukraine; or that Foreign Policy explained why Washington needs a “Russian intervention”.

"This is a recurring disinformation narrative from pro-Kremlin outlets claiming the West and NATO troops in particular are directly involved in Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine on the Ukrainian side.The claim also builds on the well-known Kremlin narrative of the West encircling Russia.Some NATO member states are providing Ukraine with military assistance to repel the unprovoked Russian aggression, but they are not involved in direct fighting. Ukraine receives weapons with the sole aim of restoring its territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders. Western instructors are teaching Ukrainian soldiers how to use modern weaponry, but there are no NATO troops fighting on the front. NATO condemns in the strongest possible terms Russia's war on Ukraine. NATO as an organisation is not involved in fighting in Ukraine.After so many war crimes committed by Russian troops in Ukraine, Moscow de facto ruled out prospects for a quick peaceful agreement. Kyiv’s position is that peace talks with Moscow will be possible only after the complete and unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops from the entire Ukrainian territory including the illegally annexed Crimean peninsula and the separatist-controlled regions in the East.Read more disinformation cases about the Russian unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine.

"This is a recurrent pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about Nazi Ukraine, presented as justification for Russian military aggression against Ukraine, which started on 24 February 2022. The Azov unit, which the claim indirectly references was formed in May 2014 in Mariupol from volunteers, initially as a battalion of the Special Purpose Police Patrol Service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In September 2014, it was transformed into a battalion in a regiment structure, later to the National Guard of Ukraine. The battalion sized unit strength is estimated at around 900 - 1100 persons.Although it was just one among dozens of volunteer militias, Azov unit garnered controversy over the far-right politics of its initial founders, the use of neo-Nazi symbolism in some of its insignia, and the anti-Semitic views of some members. The unit was integrated into the National Guard of Ukraine in 2015. Since its integration, Azov regiment members have repeatedly denied being a far-right political unit, although they acknowledge that it includes individuals with such views.In 2015 Ukraine issued a ban on Nazi and Communist ideologies. Generally speaking, far-right groups enjoyed a very limited presence during the Euromaidan itself and had poor results in the 2014 presidential and parliamentary elections. The ""Right Sector"" candidate received 0.7% of the vote in the May 2014 presidential elections, and the party received 1.8% of the vote in the October 2014 parliamentary elections.

"Recurrent pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives, challenging Ukraine’s statehood and presenting Poland as a state with imperial ambitions, aiming to confound the reality of Russia's unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine. It promotes a conspiracy about western plans to create a joint Polish-Ukrainian state.This disinformation message has adopted several different and sometimes contradictory forms, including allegations that Poland wants either to create a puppet proxy-state in Western Ukraine or the annexation of these territories or that it is actually President Zelenskyy who wants to cede this land due to his “Polish origin”. This effort can be interpreted as an attempt to seed mistrust between Ukraine and Poland and other Western backers of Kyiv.In fact, Poland, as well as Slovakia, Hungary and Romania, adhere to international law regarding state borders, fully support the independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and do not have any territorial claims against it. Read more about the Eastern policy of Poland here.On the contrary, it is Russia that started an unprovoked war in Europe, capturing more and more territories of a neighbouring country and has created a serious danger to European security.As such, this Kremlin claim seeks to deflect attantion away from Russia and its illegal annexation of Crimea and full scale war against Ukraine.

"Disinformation around the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian military officials announced the start of the Ukrainian counter-offensive in Kherson Oblast on August 29 as observed by the Institute for the Study of War.Ukrainian officials reported that Ukrainian forces have broken through the first line of defence in unspecified areas of Kherson Oblast and are seeking to take advantage of the disruption of Russian ground lines of communication caused by Ukrainian HIMARS strikes over many weeks.Ukrainian officials did not confirm the liberation of any settlements, but some Russian milbloggers and unnamed sources speaking with Western outlets stated that Ukrainian forces liberated several settlements west and northwest of Kherson City, near the Ukrainian bridgehead over the Inhulets River, and south of the Kherson-Dnipropetrovsk Oblast border, as summarised by theInstitute for the Study of War. The accusation of Ukrainian officials being drug addicts is a recurrent one from pro-Kremlin media, one of many, to justify the full scale invasion of Ukraine which started on 24 February 2022.

"Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about a hostile West attempting to encircle, weaken and exploit Russia.The claim that the West tries to turn Russia into a colony “pumping out” its resources is ungrounded. Russia is an independent player in the global economy and it willingly sells its mineral resources, energy and other commodities at the global market. This has been the business model freely pursued by Russian governments during decades.The present-day share of Russia in the global GDP is not “3%” but only 1.54% (2020). In 2013, the share of Russia in the global economy reached a record-high 2.55%. Since 2014, as a result of Putin’s illegal annexation of Crimea and military attack on Ukraine, the Russian economy appears in a state of a worsening crisis, so its weight in the global economy keeps reducing.The main source of the Russian economic problems is not alleged Western “colonialism”, but aggressive and corrupt policies realised by the Kremlin.The Western aid and assistance in the 1990s helped Russia a lot in its transition from Communist rule towards a free-market economy. What Western nations strive for - both back in the 1990s and now - is a democratic, stable and corruption-free Russia at peace with its neighbours.See related cases: The US is threatening the security of Russia; Russia's development and stability is being thwarted by the Westand The West is organising information attacks to weaken Russia’s economy.

Ursula von der Leyen was elected on 16 July 2019.The European Council (EU heads of state or government) proposes a presidential candidate to the Parliament.

Once approved, the European Council officially appoints the new President.Moreover the European Commission never declared war to Russia.

"Recurrent pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about ‘Nazi Ukraine’ and lacking or artificial Ukrainian statehood. The claim about USD 5 billion foreign assistance monthly probably stems from Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement that due to Russia's full-scale offensive Ukraine's monthly budget deficit is currently assessed at USD 5 billion. The devastating blow to Ukraine's economy -- not speaking of huge human toll due to the Russian aggressive war -- does not however back the recurring disinformation claim about a ""puppet-like statehood"". On the contrary, in the face of large-scale aggression the Ukrainian people has demonstrated a resolute will to defend Ukrainian statehood. Available sociological surveys show high levels of Zelenskyy’s public approval. IRI Ukraine poll of late June 2022 showed that 91% of Ukrainians approve of Zelenskyy’s performance. The poll also found strong confidence in victory over Russia, little desire for territorial concessions, and a spike for NATO membership.The claim about Ukraine's financing support is intended to question the viability of Ukrainian statehood. Pro-Kremlin media outlets often cast doubts on Ukrainian statehood and claim that Ukraine either does not exist as a state or is going to tumble down very soon. In reality, present-day Ukraine has been on the world map since 1991 when the Soviet Union disintegrated. It has elected six presidents since then and changed parties in government several times which illustrates political diversity and democratic dynamics even during economic hardship in the wake of Russian aggression in 2014.One of the Kremlin’s most common disinformation narratives to justify its devastating war against Ukraine is the lie that Russia is pursuing the “denazification” of Ukraine.

In reality, Ukraine is not a Nazi state, does not have a Nazi ruling elite and Nazism is not Ukraine’s ideology.The myth of Nazi-ruled Ukraine has been the cornerstone of Russian disinformation about the country since the very beginning of the 2013-14 Euromaidan protests, when it was used to discredit the pro-European popular uprising in Kyiv and, subsequently, the broader pro-Western shift in Ukraine's foreign policy.In 2015, Ukraine issued a ban on Nazi and Communist ideologies. On top of that, far-right groups had a limited presence during the Euromaidan protests and have suffered defeats in every national election after that, with a united front of all radical right-wing parties in the 2019 parliamentary elections winning only 2.15% of the vote falling far short of the 5% minimum guaranteeing entry into parliament.This false myth of Nazi Ukraine is a clear propaganda narrative and served as one of the pretexts behind Russia's unjustified invasion of Ukraine.

"This is a recurring disinformation narrative from pro-Kremlin outlets discrediting the West and serving as justification for Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine.The myth of a Nazi Europe has been widely used by pro-Kremlin outlets since Russia attacked Ukraine and illegally annexed its peninsula of Crimea in 2014. The European Union was set up with the aim of ending the frequent and bloody wars between neighbours, which culminated in the Second World War. In 2012, the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for advancing the causes of peace, reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe.The myth of Nazi-ruled Ukraine appeared during the Revolution of Dignity (aka Euromaidan) protests in late 2013 - early 2014, when the then-president Viktor Yanukovych was toppled and later fled to Russia. The Kremlin has been using this myth since then to discredit Kyiv’s shift toward Euro-Atlantic policy. The far-right groups had a limited presence during the Euromaidan protests.

Large-scale wars are, by definition, bound to cause global supply shocks that trigger inflation. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has destabilised global food markets and is driving food prices up due to increased cost of production, transport and freight insurance. Russia has also destroyed substantial food stocks, production, as well as processing and transport capacities in Ukraine.Logisitically, EU sanctiond do not include trade with Ukraine. As for trade with Russia, the sanctions do not include the import of agricultural products unless a sanctioned individual is involved. Moreover, the sanctions only cover bilateral trade between the EU and Russia, meaning that third countries can import Russian agrifood products without restriction. The US also exempts transactions for food, agricultural products and medical supplies from sanctions.Financially, EU sanctions excluded a limited number of Russian banks from the SWIFT network. However, banking relations via SWIFT can still continue as normal via the other Russian banks.Read also related cases: Western sanctions cause food crisis and price growth, Sanctions against Russia worsen the economic crisis in the West, The EU lost more from sanctions than Russia, European sanctions against Russia do not work.

"Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative and a conspiracy theory about Ukraine alleging the country's political and military leadership is perpetrating attacks against civilians and organising terrorist acts. The assassination of Darya Dugina took place in Moscow on August 20, when her car blew up and burned out. Pro-Kremlin propagandists immediately accused Ukraine. Later, Russian officials announced that Ukraine was behind the assassination, even though the provided ""evidence"" are dubious(see also: here and here) and cannot be independently verified.Ukraine denied the accusations. EU condemn all attacks on civilians, including the car explosion in the Moscow region which killed Ms Darya Dugina on Saturday 20 August 2022. The EU consider a full and impartial investigation of the incident important.An organisation called The National Republican Army took responsibility for the accident. Former Russian MP Ilya Ponomarev claims that the organisation represents a Russian partisan movement dedicated to overthrowing the Putin regime. This disinformation claim appeared in the same broadcast as an allegation that British intelligence may be behind the assassination of Darya Dugina and that Ukraine is a terrorist state."

Sanctions are a globally recognised mechanism applied against states, organisations, and/or individuals that may threaten international security.The EU has the right to impose economic sanctions within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter. Crucially, any such measures must strictly conform to European and international law, and:""respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, as general principles of Union law.""

"This article falsely accuses Ukraine of shelling the Zaporizhzhia NPP and promotes disinformation about staged atrocities in the Ukrainian town of Bucha.Pro-Kremlin media presented atrocities committed by Russian forces in Bucha as a Ukrainian provocation, set-up to unleash World War III, a coordinated attack by the Western media, a distraction from “US biological laboratories” in Ukraine, and a British plot. As explained in our analysis, this was one of many attempts to distract and obfuscate the facts of war crimes.Russia has been blaming Ukraine for the alleged shelling of the occupied Zaporizhzhia NPP for weeks but no evidence is provided to back these claims. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) warns about the risk of Russia's militarisation of the Zaporizhzhia NPP. According to recent data, Russia mined the territory of the plant and placed its military armaments near nuclear reactors and nuclear waste storage facilities.A video shared by Russian opposition outlet The Insider shows that Russian military vehicles move in and around the plant, some of them (including armored vehicles) moved into the building containing the first of the plant’s six nuclear reactors. Besides this, Russian forces dug trenches and establish firing positions.EU High Representative Josep Borrell condemned Russia’s military activities there and labelled them as a serious and irresponsible breach of nuclear safety rules and another example of Russia’s disregard for international norms.In its recent statement, the Foreign Ministers of the G7 stated that ""it is Russia’s continued control of the plant that endangers the region"" and demanded Russia to hand back full control over the plant as well as other occupied nuclear facilities to Ukraine.See earlier disinformation cases alleging that Ukrainian forces want to destroy Zaporizhzhya NPP, that Kyiv's accusations of killings in Bucha are a provocation, and that the images of dead bodies in Bucha may be a diversion of attention from US biolabs in Ukraine.Technical remark: This disinformation was broadcast via Sputnik on 18 August 2022.

"Some links may contain graphic content.This is a recurring disinformation narrative from pro-Kremlin outlets about the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, accusing Ukraine of war crimes, aiming to deflect attention from the actions of the Russian army. In reality, Ukraine is using high-precision Western weapons to strike Russian military targets in Ukrainian territory without affecting civilians. Crimea is internationally recognised Ukrainian territory where Kyiv may hit any Russian military facilities. Such objects can be legitimate targets of Ukrainian strikes, although Ukraine’s Defence Ministry has neither confirmed nor denied involvement in explosions there. According to a Ukrainian government report circulated internally, Kyiv is behind three explosions in Crimea. However, this information has not been officially confirmed.Ukraine does not intimidate civilians in Crimea. Ukrainian forces target only military facilities in the occupied peninsula. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned civilians of possible future strikes and called on them to stay away from military objects to be out of danger.It is Russian troops who are striking civilian facilities to wreak havoc and intimidate civilians. Russian soldiers have committed numerous war crimes in Bucha and Irpin outside Kyiv, in Mariupol and other Ukrainian places. "
"This is an unsubstantiated claim by pro-Kremlin outlets made in the context of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, blaming the West for the situation on the Zaporizhzhia NPP.The pro-Kremlin disinformation claim that Ukraine carries out false flag attacks and provocations is designed to deflect blame for the war atrocities away from their real perpetrators. The claim is part of a wider pro-Kremlin campaign accusing Ukraine and its allies of preparing a false-flag incident in Zaporizhzhia.This is not the first time the Kremlin’s manipulation and disinformation machine has used a deep-seated and very reasonable fear of a nuclear disaster to advance its political and military goals in Ukraine.In fact, there have been an increasing number of reports that Russia uses the nuclear site as a so-called “sheltered” artillery park, ""using the facilities to fire on Ukrainian positions in the belief that Ukraine would not fire back and risk a nuclear accident"".

"Recurring manipulation comparing the European Union to Nazi Germany. A decision to ban Schengen visas for Russian citizens has not been made yet. It will be a topic of discussion at a meeting of the EU foreign ministers in Prague at the end of August 2022. The argument for the ban on visas for Russian citizens is based on the statement of the Prime Minister of Estonia, Kaja Kallas, that “visiting Europe is a privilege, not a human right”. These words were said in the context of the ongoing Russian military invasion of Ukraine. The idea of the ban on visas was also supported by Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelenskyy. His argument was that Russians should “live in their own world until they change their philosophy.” Kremlin-backed disinformation outlets quite often use non-argument comparisons to Nazism and similar historical parallels. See more examples in our previous cases: Limited military operation liberates LPR from the Ukrainian Nazi rule; Nazism is one of the highest European values; The West and Kyiv exterminated Russians in Ukraine and built a Nazi state.

"The claim is part of an ongoing pro-Kremlin disinformation campaign concerning Russia’s criminal invasion of Ukraine.The argument that the full scale invasion conformed to the UN Charter was also promptly dismissed by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres himself (at 6:33):“The use of force by one country against another is the repudiation of the principles that every country committed to uphold. This applies to the present military offensive. It is wrong. It is against the (United Nations) Charter. It is unacceptable.”.There is no evidence that ethnic Russians were facing persecution at the hands of the Ukrainian authorities, much less the danger of annihilation on grounds of nationality, ethnicity, or cultural belonging.

"This baseless claim appeared in a documentary series of four episodes titled “Mariupol: Chronicles of a Russian city”, broadcast by RT Spanish in August 2022. The allegation is part of a broader disinformation campaign to prepare the ground and justify the illegal annexation of Ukrainian territories by Russia.Mariupol cannot be considered a Russian city under any prism. Prior to WWI it was part of the Russian Empire, but so was most of the rest of Ukraine and a big part of what is today Polish territory (see map here). After the outbreak of the Ukrainian-Soviet war in 1917, it became part of the so-called Ukrainian People’s Republic and was afterwards occupied by German and Austrian troops as a result of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. In 1921, it became part of the new Socialist Republic of Ukraine, which was soon integrated in the USSR. Mariupol was always recognised by Russian authorities as Ukrainian territory, both during Soviet times and after Ukraine’s independence in 1991.See other examples of similar disinformation narratives, such as claims that a referendum and a coup forced Luhansk and Donetsk to declare independence, that the Russian liberation of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk ended discrimination and abuse, that “Azov” admitted in a secret document that the majority of Mariupol residents support Russia, or that the Financial Times reported that Ukraine threatened Russia with terrorist attacks on its territory.

"Recurring narrative presenting Poland as a state with imperial ambitions, aiming to confound the reality of Russia's unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine.The multiple claims made in this disinformation story - 1) that Poland is preparing to seize Ukrainian territory; 2) that the condition for aiding Ukraine is to transfer this territory to Poland, to which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed; and 3) that the Poles admit it - are all unfounded, and no evidence is presented to back them up. The mention of “Polish media” can hardly be considered proof, as these outlets are not identified.The false allegation that Poland was plotting with the US to divide Ukraine and take over some territory was initially spread by the head of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) Sergei Narishkin in April 2022, and later repeated by the head of Russia’s National Security Council Nikolai Patrushev and other top officials. This disinformation message has adopted several different and sometimes contradictory forms, including allegations that Poland wants either to create a puppet proxy-state in Western Ukraine or the annexation of these territories or that it is actually President Zelenskyy who wants to cede this land due to his “Polish origin”. This effort can be interpreted as an attempt to seed mistrust between Ukraine and Poland and other Western backers of Kyiv.In fact, Poland adheres to international law regarding state borders, fully supports the independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, it does not have any territorial claims against its neighbours and it rejects any “imperial” ambitions towards other countries.

"Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative trying to deflect any Russian responsibility for the atrocities committed during its unjustified aggression against Ukraine. This disinformation story mixes different episodes that must be analysed separately. The so-called “Ghost of Kyiv” was a fictional character created as part of a classic war propaganda operation designed to boost the morale of Ukrainian pilots, as the Ukrainian Air Force itself has admitted itself. Reports about the death of the Ukrainian soldiers who resisted the Russian invasion at Snake Island, who were initially granted official posthumous homages, were the result of early misinformation, and Ukrainian authorities corrected it and informed that they were alive and in Russian captivity as early as 28 February. Nonetheless, this disinformation story tries to present these very different incidents as evidence of alleged psychological operations (“psy-ops”) and disinformation against Russia, while disingenuously merging them with false allegations that the bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol and the Bucha massacre, both of which took place in March 2022, were staged.The facts surrounding the Russian bombing of the maternity ward in Mariupol were carefully documented through a large number of pictures from several sources – professional news photographers, social media updates and forensic investigators (see here for our previous debunk of this claim). Evidence of Russian atrocities in Bucha is also overwhelming (see here for our previous debunk of this claim). See here and here for EUvsDisinfo background articles on these episodes.See other examples of similar disinformation messages in our database, such as claims that the images of dead bodies in Bucha may be a diversion of attention from US biolabs in Ukraine, that Ukrainians committed crimes in Bucha, not Russians, that accusations about Bucha are as false as claims that Russia bombed a maternity hospital in Mariupol, or that Ukraine is under control of the West and staged fakes about Bucha, Mariupol and Kramatorsk.

"Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation about the atrocities of the Ukrainian army in Donbas, such as war crimes and genocide. This is part of a disinformation campaign aiming to justify Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine.There is no evidence to support the claims of genocide by Ukraine. The Ukrainian authorities did not systematically exterminate or abuse the people living in the conflict zone. The claimed dead people – military and civilian alike - are a result of a war Russia had started in Ukraine. It was not an internal civil conflict but a well-documented act of aggression by Russian armed forces, ongoing since February 2014. The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine which has closely monitored the conflict has observed no such genocide.On the contrary, there is numerous evidence that Russia is committing war crimes in Ukraine, such as the shelling of shopping malls, killing civilians, raping, as well as using unprecise weapons. There is documented evidence that, for instance, the shooting of civilians in Bucha was done by Russian troops. Several executions and shootings of Ukrainian civilians in Bucha were recorded on video by witnesses and Ukrainian drones. Satellite images show that some of the corpses were already lying on the streets weeks before the Russian withdrawal. Incriminatory radio conversations by Russian troops were intercepted and released by German intelligence. Furthermore, a similar pattern of Russian war crimes is emerging in places like Borodyanka, Chernihiv, Hostomel, and others. There is also verified evidence showing that Russia is responsible for a strike at a shopping mall in the city of Kremenchuk on 27 June 2022 and in the city of Vinnytsia on 14 July 2022.

"A claim presented without any evidence or base. In addition, the claim was not counterbalanced or critically challenged in the article. Under the Budapest memorandum in 1994, Ukraine promised to remove all Soviet-era nuclear weapons from its territory, send them to disarmament facilities in Russia, and sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Ukraine kept these promises. In return, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States promised that none of them would ever threaten or use force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine. They specifically pledged they would refrain from making each other's territory the object of military occupation or engage in other uses of force in violation of international law.

"This claim is part of a pro-Kremlin disinformation campaign regarding a recently published Amnesty International report on the war in Ukraine.While the report did criticise the Ukrainian armed forces for launching strikes from within populated residential areas, it in no way used terms like ""terrorist tactics"" or ""human shields"". In fact, nothing in the report suggests that this was a deliberate policy by the Ukrainian armed forces. On the other hand, the report makes it clear that these violations should not be used to justify Russian indiscriminate attacks against civilians using internationally banned cluster munitions, a deliberate policy that constitutes a war crime. This section of the report was completely ignored by pro-Kremlin media. The report reads:""Many of the Russian strikes that Amnesty International documented in recent months were carried out with inherently indiscriminate weapons, including internationally banned cluster munitions, or with other explosive weapons with wide area effects. Others used guided weapons with varying levels of accuracy; in some cases, the weapons were precise enough to target specific objects.The Ukrainian military’s practice of locating military objectives within populated areas does not in any way justify indiscriminate Russian attacks. All parties to a conflict must at all times distinguish between military objectives and civilian objects and take all feasible precautions, including in choice of weapons, to minimize civilian harm. Indiscriminate attacks which kill or injure civilians or damage civilian objects are war crimes.""The report has been crticised for being loop-sided, failing to adress the full scale of the Russian atrocities and becoming a tool in Russian propaganda.

Most of these labs are actively engaged in fighting dangerous diseases and viruses, including COVID-19. Many of the labs are part of the US Department of Defense’s Biological Threat Reduction Program (BTRP).The overwhelming consensus among scientists and medical experts is that SARS-CoV-2 has all the characteristics of a naturally occurring virus. Numerous peer-reviewed scientific studies from reputable academic journals have shown substantial empirical evidence that the virus is naturally occurring. PREDICT, a project of USAID’s Emerging Pandemic Threats (EPT) programme, was initiated in 2009 to strengthen global capacity for the detection and discovery of zoonotic viruses with pandemic potential.

By doing so, these two countries are enhancing their security and protect themselves from Russian threatsAll decisions in NATO are taken by consensus, which means that a decision can only be taken if every single member accepts it. No member of the Alliance can order the deployment of armed forces of other member states. There is no hierarchy between member states, and no member state can order another to do something it doesn’t want.

In 1992, Ukraine signed the Lisbon Protocol and it joined the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear weapon state in 1994. In exchange, the leaders of the US, Russia and the UK signed the Budapest memorandum with guarantees on the integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine. Through the Budapest memorandum, Russia pledged not to use any weapon against Ukraine, not just nuclear.In 1998, Ukraine signed an Agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the Application of Safeguards in Connection with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and in 2006 a Protocol Additional to the Agreement which provides for strict control not only over the nuclear material present on the territory of the country, but for any nuclear research.Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, support of separatists in eastern Ukraine and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 by Russia are a clear violation of the Budapest memorandum.The claim about the creation of nuclear weapons at the Zaporizhzhia NPP is unfounded. There has been an increasing number of reports about Russia using the nuclear power plant as a so-called “sheltered” artillery park, ""using the facilities to fire on Ukrainian positions in the belief that Ukraine would not fire back and risk a nuclear accident"".

"This is a recurring disinformation narrative from pro-Kremlin outlets about Finland’s and Sweden’s future membership of NATO.In fact, Finland has always been striving for good-neighbourly relations with Russia. Helsinki's decision to enter NATO is a justified attempt to protect itself as Moscow is waging its war of aggression against Ukraine. The blame for the deterioration in relations between Finland and Russia falls entirely on Moscow because it is threatening security by its aggressive behaviour in the whole of Europe. Russia also makes provocative military flights and maneuvres over its neighbours in the Baltic region. For example, a Russian Mi-17 helicopter violated Finnish airspace in May 2022. In April, Finnish authorities accused a Russian IL-96-300 of violating the country’s airspace in the Gulf of Finland. Sweden and Denmark have also experienced repeated violations or provocations by Russian planes and warships. On 18 May 2022, Finland and Sweden simultaneously handed in their official letters of application to join NATO, a momentous step for the two historically militarily non-aligned countries. The leaders of both countries have made it clear that the decision to apply for membership is a direct consequence of Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. An opinion poll conducted in early May 2022 saw over three-quarters of Finns in favour of NATO membership, whereas a mere 12% of respondents took the opposite view.Read more disinformation cases about Finland and Sweden’s future membership of NATO and claims that NATO is posing a threat to Russia.

"This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation claim accusing the US and the EU of undermining Ukrainian statehood, portraying Ukraine as a dependent puppet of the US and the EU. The statement about the slavish dependence of Ukraine on the US and the EU is completely devoid of any logic. Russian and pro-Kremlin disinformation sources like to claim that certain countries are no longer truly sovereign. See our article ‘Lost Sovereignty’ here.Ukraine is a sovereign country with its own national interests. It is not controlled by any Western government or organisation. Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are respected by almost the whole world with Russia as the key exception. Ukraine is a priority partner for the EU and the US. During the European Council on 23 June 2022, EU leaders granted EU candidate status to Ukraine. The US attaches great importance to the success of Ukraine as a free and democratic state. Pro-Kremlin media outlets often cast doubts on Ukrainian statehood and claim that Ukraine either does not exist as a state or is going to tumble down very soon, or it is a colony of the West. In reality, present-day Ukraine has been on the world map since 1991 when the Soviet Union disintegrated. It has elected six presidents since then and changed parties in government several times which illustrates political diversity and democratic dynamics even during economic hardship in the wake of Russian aggression in 2014.Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity have been violated by continuous acts of aggression by Russian armed forces since 2014 and culminated in an aggressive attack on a neighbouring country on February 24, 2022.The EU and US have taken concrete actions to support Ukraine.

"This is a recurring disinformation narrative from pro-Kremlin outlets claiming that NATO has aggressive intentions against Russia and accusing the West in general of Russophobia.In reality, Western nations have been trying to establish good relations with Russia since the breakup of the former Soviet Union in 1991. According to the Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security between NATO and the Russian Federation in 1997, “NATO and Russia do not consider each other as adversaries.” At their recent summit in Madrid, NATO leaders adopted a new strategic blueprint branding Russia as “the most significant and direct threat to Allies’ security and to peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area.” But it does not mean that NATO is posing a threat to Russia. The alliance only wants to ensure the security of its member states. NATO is primarily a political organisation, which aims at solving conflicts by peaceful means. Finland’s and Sweden’s future membership of the alliance is caused by their desire to protect themselves from possible threats and challenges in the future rather than by NATO’s alleged intention to inflict harm on Russia.Since Russia re-started its unjustified aggression against Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the West has been calling for a peaceful settlement. Due to Russia’s refusal to seriously discuss a diplomatic solution and its resolve to continue fighting and targeting civilian objects, Western nations took a tougher stand and imposed sanctions on Moscow and certain Russian individuals. These measures are not to be considered threatening or aggressive because they only aim to stop fighting rather than to infringe harm on the vital interests of Russians.It is true that some NATO member states are providing military assistance to Ukraine in repelling Russia’s unprovoked war of aggression. This aid is of defensive character. Ukraine is using these weapons to fight the Russian invasion. It does not intend to move forward into Russian territory after defeating the Russian aggression. The fact that some Western leaders have said unequivocally that Ukraine will win the war (see here and here) does not mean that NATO is threatening Russia. Their statements only imply the West’s desire to help Ukraine restore its territorial integrity in its internationally recognised borders including the peninsula of Crimea and Donbas.Read more disinformation cases claiming that NATO is posing a threat to Russia and accusing the West of Russophobia.

Not all trades restrictions are yet enforced as the energy sector needs longer transition periods so it is too early to assess the full effect of the sanction as that work in a the long term.

"Recurrent pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about Euromaidan and Nazi/fascist Ukraine and the US presence in Europe, recently rebooted to justify Russia's invasion of Ukraine.The myth of Nazi-ruled Ukraine has been the cornerstone of Russian disinformation about the country since the very beginning of the 2013–14 Euromaidan protests, when it was used to discredit the pro-European popular uprising in Kyiv and, subsequently, the broader pro-Western shift in Ukraine's foreign policy.In fact, far-right groups enjoyed a very limited presence during the Euromaidan protests and got abysmal results in the 2014 presidential and parliamentary elections. During the 2019 election cycle, the far right managed to sustain an even more tremendous failure; the highest-rated nationalist candidate, Ruslan Koshulynskyy, won 1.62% of the vote whereas Svoboda, one of the Kremlin's favourite bogeymen, won 2.16% of the national vote, falling far short of the 5% minimum guaranteeing entry into parliament.Moreover, Euromaidan was an organic reaction by numerous parts of the Ukrainian population to former President Yanukovych’s sudden departure from the promised Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013.

Ukraine has never threatened Russia. It was Russia who illegally annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and instigated a separatist revolt in Donbas in 2014. It has been threatening Ukraine with more territorial losses ever since. Ukraine and its Western partners have been trying to find a diplomatic solution to the war, but Russia has made it impossible to reach a peaceful settlement because of its continual bombing of civilian objects. In order to force Moscow into stopping hostilities, the European Council adopted a sixth package of economic and individual sanctions against Russia and Belarus on 3 June 2022. This package includes restrictions on exports, prohibition of consulting services, de-SWIFTing of additional banks, suspension of the broadcasting activities of several state-owned outlets, as well as individual sanctions.Contrary to Russian claims that its troops target only military facilities in Ukraine, a lot of civilian infrastructure has been damaged or ruined and thousands of Ukrainian civilians have been killed. According to unofficial data, up to 22,000 civilians have died in Mariupol alone. Russian troops killed hundreds of civilians in the town of Bucha outside Kyiv.

Days before the new war in February, Putin had offered several reasons for launching aggression, including the necessity to help non-government-controlled territories in Eastern Ukraine from a genocide, Ukraine’s alleged desire to obtain nuclear weapons and Kyiv’s possible membership of NATO. These were only pretexts because Putin had seemingly taken the decision to invade Ukraine long before.In late 2021 and early 2022, Western nations were trying to conduct a constructive dialogue with Moscow on all disputed issues including security guarantees.

It was Putin’s personal decision to invade Ukraine and start the largest military conflict in Europe since WWII.The myth of Nazi-ruled Ukraine appeared as the Kremlin's reaction to the Euromaidan protests in late 2013 - early 2014, when the then-president Viktor Yanukovych was toppled and later fled to Russia. The Kremlin has been using this myth since then to discredit Kyiv’s shift towards Euro-Atlantic policy. Contrary to what this disinformation narrative affirms, in 2015, Ukraine issued a ban on Nazi and Communist ideologies. On top of that, far-right groups had a very limited presence during the protests and have suffered defeats in every national election after that.This false myth of Nazi Ukraine is a clear propaganda narrative that became a cornerstone in pro-Kremlin disinformation and served as one of the pretexts behind Russia's unjustified invasion of Ukraine.

"Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about neo-Nazi Ukraine, which is abandoned by the West, but also a puppet of the West. It cynically calls the Russia-occupated territories of Ukraine 'liberated' under the false pretext of 'Nazi' Ukrainian authorities.The article promotes a false claim about the German parliament’s anti-NATO position. The position of individual German parliamentarians is presented as of the whole Bundestag. In fact, the majority of the German lawmakers firmly support NATO. In early July 2022, the overwhelming majority of the German Bundestag swiftly backed Finland and Sweden’s bids to join NATO. Furthermore, a conspiracy is promoted concerning the West’s ultimatum to Kyiv regarding the town of Slavyansk and arms support – there is no proof to it whatsoever and is part of a long series of claims meant to undermine Ukraine's statehood and sovereignty.

"Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative aiming to deflect Russia’s responsibility for the growing food crisis and supply insecurity. This claim was made in the context of Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.EU sanctions are directed against the Russian government, the financial sector and the economic elites, targeting the Kremlin's ability to finance the military aggression. No sanctions target food production or export. The US also exempts transactions for food, agricultural products and medical supplies from sanctions.The Russian invasion of Ukraine has destabilised global food markets and is driving food prices up due to increased cost of production, transport and freight insurance. Russia has destroyed substantial food stocks, production, as well as processing and transport capacities in Ukraine.In spite of the recent agreement brokered brookered with the UN and Ankara, only very few Ukrainian ships leave the Black Sea ports with food export. Russia's de-facto naval blockade and attacks on harbours has prevented more than 20 million tons of grain to leave the ports of Ukraine. Ukraine is one of the world’s top agricultural producers and exporters. Before the Russian invasion, most of the food produced by Ukraine – enough to feed 400 million people – was exported through the country’s seven Black Sea ports, according to an estimate of the World Food Programme.For more information on this topic, read the EUvsDisinfo article covering Russian disinformation related to the food security.

"Newly adapted version of a recurring conspiracy theory alleging that the United States develops biological weapons and has secret biological laboratories around the world. The disinformation claim also capitalises on the oft-recurring conspiracy theory about laboratories in Ukraine, as well as the Lugar Lab in Georgia. These claims are made in the context of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine.The US Embassy in Ukraine has repeatedly denied the ""creation of military biological laboratories"" in Ukraine.The cooperation between Ukraine and the United States in the direction of combating biological terrorism takes place exclusively within the framework of Ukrainian legislation and in the interests of Ukraine.In 2005, the Ministry of Health of Ukraine and the U.S. Department of Defence signed a framework agreement on preventing the spread of technologies, pathogens and knowledge that can be used in the development of biological weapons. Within the framework of this Agreement, a number of state laboratories located in Odesa, Kharkiv, L'viv, Kyiv, Vinnytsia, Kherson and Dnipro regions were modernised (repair works were carried out, equipment was updated, consumables were purchased, etc.).The Security Service of Ukraine emphasises that these laboratories are financed from the state budget, subordinated to the Ministry of Health and the State Service of Ukraine for Food Safety and Consumer Protection.Read further debunk by StopFake.org.See similar disinfo cases alleging that there are dangerous American labs close to the Russian border, that Kazakhstan is a testing ground for production of dangerous diseases, that coronavirus was created by Americans in a biolaboratory in Kazakhstan, that the US develops biologcal weapons in Ukrainian laboratories, that the people of Armenia, Georgia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan are ""biomaterial"" for the Pentagon, and that Pentagon controls the work of 15 bacteriological laboratories in Ukraine.

"Pro-Kremlin disinformation about the war in Ukraine, obfuscating Russia's responsibility in the global food security crisis. In fact, Russia's continuous shelling of Ukraine has caused numerous large-scale fires in wheat and barley fields. For example, in the Kherson region, shelling has led to the burning of hundreds of hectares of wheat and barley fields. Additionally, the Ukrainian national police estimate that around 600 hectares (1,500 acres) including wheat and rapeseed were burned in Zaporizhzhia after just one-day of Russian air-strikes on 12 July. Another 800 hectares were destroyed the week before.On June 10 already, it was estimated that Russian shelling had caused the destruction of 50,000 ton of grain in Mariupol alone.Export of grain and food products is one of Ukraine's main incomes so setting this on fire is contary to any logic and reflects a sinister lie of the pro-Kremlin media.Read also similar disinformation cases trying to absolve Russia from its responsibility in causing the food crisis: Ukrainians burned 50,000 tons of grain in Mariupol on purpose; The food crisis is associated primarily with the sanctions of the US and the West; Ukraine is responsible for its inability to export grains and lack of food export; Ukraine is paying for weapons with grain.

"A recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about biological weapons and biological research laboratories. This disinformation message is a part of the Kremlin's disinformation efforts to obfuscate the atrocities committed by the Russian armed forces in Ukraine. The disinformation narrative about biological weapons and biological research laboratories is often reinforced with allegations that birds, rats and reptiles are being poisonedin such laboratories with a special substance targeting ethnic Russians.The United States embassy in Ukraine has issued statements dispelling disinformation about US biological weapons being produced in secret laboratories in Ukraine or other former Soviet republics. Ukraine participates in the US Department of Defence's Biological Threat Reduction Programme (BTRP). This co-operation aims at safeguarding global health by preventing the outbreak of contagious diseases. Both countries work together to consolidate and secure pathogens and toxins of security concern in Ukrainian state-run facilities. Ukraine also received four mobile scientific and medical laboratories to counter COVID-19 pandemic. No biological experiments are being carried out on human being in these laboratories.The United Nations high representative for disarmament, Izumi Nakamitsusaid in March 2022 that the UN was “not aware of any biological weapons programmes” in Ukraine.Read similar cases claiming that COVID-19 likely the fault of the US; it runs dozens of deadly biolabs around the world, the US is developing biological weapons in laboratories in post-Soviet republics or that Ukraine is a testing ground for US biological war against Russia "
"This is an unsubstantiated claim by pro-Kremlin outlets made in the context of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine.There is no evidence proving that Ukraine or its Western partners are planning such actions. The US embassy in Ukraine issued a security alert on 14 July 2022 and urged US citizens to depart immediately - it was a general warning to be vigilant and an explaination what action must be taken in the event of danger.The situation in Ukraine continues to be violent and unpredictable due to Russia’s unprovoked war of aggression. It is Russia which is often involved in provocations. Russian troops wanted to stage a provocation at an occupied atomic power plant in the Zaporizhzhia Region where they detained several workers and tortured them to confess that they had dropped weapons into the concrete bowls of the cooling ponds. Under this pretext, the occupiers insisted on draining the cooling ponds to check their bottoms and stop the pumps that supply water to the safety systems of power units. It might leave the power plant without cooling, which could threaten nuclear safety. Russian forces also deployed artillery systems, rocket launchers, tanks and personnel carriers at the same power plant, turning it into a military base. They did it purposefully to prevent a Ukrainian counterattack.

"Recurring disinformation campaign about alleged Russophobia in Ukraine aimed to justify Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine. This claim is consistent with disinformation narratives about ‘Nazi’ Ukraine.The rights of Russian-speaking citizens are guaranteed by the Ukrainian constitution and legislation. Articles 10 and 11 of the Constitution guarantee the free development of the languages and cultures of Ukraine’s ethnic minorities, including Russian-speakers.Russian-speaking Ukrainians, as well as other national minorities, are not second-rate citizens. This claim was shaped by the fact that in 2021 President Volodymyr Zelenskyy submitted to the Verkhovna Rada (parliament) a draft law, ""On the indigenous peoples of Ukraine."" Pro-Kremlin outlets have claimed that this bill divides all citizens into three categories: ethnic Ukrainians, indigenous peoples, and others. This is not true, because the bill is aimed at protecting three peoples who are indigenous to Crimea and who are threatened due to Russia's discriminatory policy in the illegally annexed Ukrainian peninsula. These ethnic communities are Crimean Tatars, Karaites and Krymchaks. This bill is not aimed against other ethnic groups who live in Ukraine and enjoy equal rights, regardless of their ethnic origin.There is no evidence that ethnic Russians in Donbas were facing persecution at the hands of the Ukrainian authorities, much less the danger of annihilation on grounds of nationality, ethnicity, or cultural belonging. This has been confirmed by reports issued by the Council of Europe, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the OSCE. For an overview of the Kremlin's deployment of the ""genocide"" narrative regarding Ukraine, see further debunking by EUvsDisinfo, Euromaidan Press, and POLYGRAPH.info.Read similar cases claiming that Ukraine bans everything Russian, treats ethnic Russians as second-rate citizens and that Russian language is banned in Ukrainian regions controlled by the Kyiv junta "

"This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, claiming that Russian military does not strike civilian infrastructure.The material and links may contain distressing/ graphic content.In reality, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres’s response to Russia’s bombing of several civilian objects in the Ukrainian city of Vinnytsia on 14 July 2022 was as follows:“The Secretary-General is appalled by today's missile attack against the city of Vinnytsia in central Ukraine that reportedly killed at least 22 people, including three children and wounded more than 100 others. The Secretary-General condemns any attacks against civilians or civilian infrastructure and reiterates his call for accountability for such violations.”It was an objective and unbiased statement without even mentioning Russia as the perpetrator.It is a well-established fact that Russian missiles struck several civilian objects in Vinnytsia on 14 July 2022, killing at least 23 people, among them several children. A business centre in downtown Vinnytsia, an Officers’ House and several houses were targeted. Russian propaganda reports claimed that Nazis were deployed in the Officers’ House. However, Officers’ Houses in Ukraine are not military facilities. They are civilian objects where cultural, educational, and leisure activities are carried out. Concerts and other social events are often held there.The UN is striving to put an end to the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine. Antonio Guterres has visited both Moscow and Kyiv in an attempt to secure a truce or ceasefire. The UN is also taking part in talks aimed at lifting the Russian blockade of Ukrainian seaports so that Ukraine is able to export its agricultural produce and avert a possible famine in the world.The EU's HRVP Josep Borrell and Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarčič condemned Russian attacks against civilian targets, calling the events in Vinnytsia an atrocity, ""the latest in a long series of brutal attacks targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure.""Read more about the EU's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine along with EU vs Disinfo's Guide to Deciphering Pro-Kremlin disinformation around Putin's War.
