22.11.2022,oroszhirek.hu,"Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about false flag operations. Such claims are a part of a broader pro-Kremlin disinformation campaign accompanying the full scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, trying to place the blame on Ukraine.Ukrainian military intelligence said on the 21st of October that Russia had conducted the main mining works of the dam back in April 2022, but warned that the floodgates and supports of the dam were further primed the previous week. Two military vehicles full of explosives were placed on the road that crosses the dam, the agency added.The 30 metre-high dam, which holds back 18m cubic metres of water, straddles the Dnipro River upstream from Russian-held Kherson and is about 20 miles from advancing Ukrainian forces hoping to recapture both it and the occupied city.Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has accused Russia of plotting to blow up the two-mile Nova Kakhovka dam in the south of the country, warning its destruction would cause “a large-scale disaster” affecting towns and cities.According to Ukrainian Military Intelligence Chief Kyrylo Budanov Russia will slow Ukrainian troops' advance in the south by two weeks if it blows up the vast Kakhovka dam, but such a move would flood territory occupied by Moscow's forces and lose it a vital water source for annexed Crimea.Blowing up the dam would also ""destroy the possibility of the existence of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant because this facility is inextricably linked to it"".The nuclear plant, Europe's largest, has been occupied by Russian forces for months and is located near the reservoir.On the 11th of November the Russian retreated from Kherson. Russians had to openly announce their withdrawal as they could not hold the city any longer, as their troops (about 30,000 in that area) could not deter the Ukrainian offensive for a long time. Significant new damage to the major Nova Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine can be seen following Russia's withdrawal from nearby Kherson city, U.S. satellite imagery company Maxar said on Friday 11 November.Read similar cases claiming that West needs provocations to accuse the Russian military of using chemical, biological or nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Ukrainian militants are shelling the nuclear station in Zaporizhzhia and that Ukraine wants to blow up the Kakhovka dam to block water supply to Crimea.",Real,Russia retreated from Kherson because Ukraine wanted to blow up the Kakhovka dam

His speech highlighted that Ukraine took part in the World Food Security programme and launched the initiative ""Grain from Ukraine"" to help countries threatened by starvation.“Ukraine can export 45 million tons of food this year. And let a significant part of it be directed to those who suffer the most.”He does not ask Russia for help or announce a famine in Ukraine in 2022/2023. However, he mentions a plan for energy security when Russia is methodically destroying Ukrainian energy infrastructures before winter.One can “witness what the Russian terror is aimed at now. This is an attempt to turn the cold into a weapon. A weapon against millions of people. »Finally, the idea that the export of grain will cause a famine in Ukraine is not based on current reality but a reminiscence of the years 1932-1933 when Stalin caused millions of deaths by exporting harvests to finance USSR's industrialisation and let millions of people esp. in Ukraine die of starvation.Read also related cases: Kyiv and the West are causing hunger in the world, Russia does not allow Kyiv to organise Holodomor in Ukraine, and Washington seeks its money back arranging a famine in Ukraine.",Real,The West and Zelenskyy cause famine in Ukraine and beg Russia for help

22.11.2022,RIA,"False pro-Kremlin narrative. In reality, the Dutch court found that, since April 2014, there had been an armed conflict between the Ukrainian army and separatist formations, controlled by Russia, reports Dutch Courts´ website Rechtspraak.""One of these groups fought under the name of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR). Many indications suggest that since mid-May 2014, the DPR has been effectively controlled by the Russian Federation. As a result, the Russian Federation became so involved in the conflict with Ukraine that it became an international conflict. In an international conflict, the use of weapons may be permitted under certain circumstances. Soldiers from belligerent countries may invoke immunity (combatant immunity) and not be prosecuted. But because the Russian Federation and the suspects deny Russian involvement to this day, the DNR fighters cannot be seen as part of the Russian military. In this case, they cannot be granted immunity from prosecution"", summarises Rechtspraak.

In May 2018, the JIT announced its conclusion that the missile which shot down the plane came from Russia’s 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade.

Although some claims are technically true, the OHCHR described abuses against Russian POWs by Ukrainian forces as “sporadic cases of torture and ill-treatment”.

At the same time, this disinformation story completely ignores the OHCHR denunciations about abuses against Ukrainian POWs held by Russian forces expressed in the same document. The UN mission affirmed that “the vast majority” of Ukrainian prisoners it interviewed said they were tortured and ill-treated, and explained that while Ukrainian authorities freely allowed these interviews to take place, Russian authorities totally prevented the OHCHR from talking to Ukrainian prisoners.These distortions are an attempt to portray Ukraine in a negative light in order to justify Russia's unprovoked aggression against its neighbour.See other examples of similar disinformation narratives, such as claims that Bucha is a cover-up for Ukrainian fascists torturing Russian prisoners of war, that Ukraine is using anti-retreat troops to shoot in the back those soldiers who try to surrender, or that Ukrainians deported children from Donbas and probably sold their organs.

It’s very likely that it was a rocket used in anti-missile defence, meaning that it was used by Ukraine’s defence forces”, he explained.

The demonstrations which began in Kyiv in November 2013 – called ""Maidan"", or ""Euromaidan"" – were a result of the Ukrainian people's frustration with the former President Yanukovych. After seven years of negotiation, he refused to sign the EU–Ukraine Association Agreement and halted progress towards Ukraine's closer relationship with the EU due to Russian pressure. The protesters' demands included constitutional reform, a stronger role for parliament, the formation of a government of national unity, an end to corruption, early presidential elections and an end to violence.The myth of Nazi-ruled Ukraine has been the cornerstone of Russian disinformation about the country since the very beginning of the 2013-14 Euromaidan protests, when it was used to discredit the pro-European popular uprising in Kyiv and, subsequently, the broader pro-Western shift in Ukraine's foreign policy. Far-right groups enjoyed a very limited presence during the Euromaidan itself and had poor results in the 2019 election cycle, falling short of the 5% minimum required to enter into parliament.A law passed in Ukraine in 2015 bans Nazi and Communist ideologies. The law prohibits the public use and propaganda of Nazi and Communist symbols. Far-right groups do exist in Ukraine, like in any other country, but they have a minor influence on politics and social life.Although it was just one among dozens of volunteer militias, Azov unit garnered controversy over the far-right politics of its initial founders, the use of neo-Nazi symbolism in some of its insignia, and the anti-Semitic views of some members. The unit was integrated into the National Guard of Ukraine in 2015. Since its integration, Azov regiment members have repeatedly denied being a far-right political unit, although they acknowledge that it includes individuals with such views.Learn more about the reasons behind Kremlin's obsession with framing Ukraine as a Nazi state in the EUvsDisinfo analysis titled ""Why does Putin portray himself as the tamer of neo-Nazism"".",Real,The US and Ukraine support Nazism

""The longer-term trend for violent crime in the US since the 1990s has been generally downwards, although over the past few years it has remained relatively stable, according to FBI data"", the BBC relevant journalist report says.More broadly, the publication is consistent with the recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative that the US and the West are on the brink of an imminent collapse. Russian and pro-Kremlin disinformation outlets regularly employ this narrative, explained in our earlier analysis in detail. Examples include: the EU is on the verge of collapse, the US is collapsing, NATO is breaking down, Ukraine’s entry into the EU would provoke the bloc’s collapse, and the financial system is collapsing.Furthermore, through false claims that the US Democrats are carrying out gender experiments with kids and pushing people to change their gender the publication promotes the ‘threatened values’ disinformation narrative. The idea of a decaying West is often juxtaposed in the pro-Kremlin outlets against Russia that is the ‘guardian’ of decency and morality. See earlier cases alleging that in contrast to Russia, western Europe is abandoning Christian roots and that, unlike Russia, the West is not about fairness or solidarity and it degrades traditional values and endangers societies, while all-Russian history is highly moral.",Real,"Life is unbearable in the US with drugs, crimeand gender change propaganda"

A single sentence on the treatment of Russian culture and music is torn out of its overall context and reproduced as an anti-Russian, russophobic statement. However, the statement is of no relevance in the overall context of his speech, i.e. the political changes since 24 February, as Steinmeier points out numerous times in his speech. For example, Steinmeier calls the start of Russia's war of aggression on 24 February 2022 ""the definitive, bitter failure of years of political efforts, including my own.""""24. February was an epochal shift. It plunged us here in Germany, too, into a different time, into an uncertainty that we thought we had left behind us, a time marked by war, violence and displacement, by concerns that the war would spread across Europe like wildfire. A time of severe economic upheaval, of energy crisis."" ""Russia's brutal war of aggression in Ukraine has reduced the European security order to ashes. In his imperial obsession, the Russian President has broken international law, committed land grabs, called borders into question. The Russian attack is an attack on all of the lessons that the world had learned from the last century's two World Wars.""Referring to Russian culture and ""old dreams"" Steinmeier concludes: ""But when we look at today's Russia, there simply is no place for old dreams. Our countries are today opposed. Putin is commanding an invading army, and the Ukrainians are defending their country, which they have been building since their independence thirty years ago. Russia's war of aggression has demolished Gorbachev's dream of a ""common European home"".

Ukraine also joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has invited an international mission of experts and IAEA to verify that there is no kind of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. James Kariuki, the British ambassador to the United Nations, rejected Russia's claim, saying that Russia did not provide any evidence that Ukraine possesses such a device.

Before the full-scale invasion on 24 February, the Kremlin-owned RIA Novosti article stated that “Kyiv is literally one step away” from creating tactical nuclear weapon. It alleged that ""Russophobic authorities"" in Kyiv are acquiring a dirty bomb.

No reputable political scientists or researchers confirm the existence of a ‘Deep State’ in the United States.The claim also suggests that the US is responsible for the war in Ukraine to the extent that it would ""lead the world into extinction"". The war in Ukraine began in 2014 with the illegal annexation of Crimea and Russia's military involvement and support of separatist in Donbas. Russia’s protracted invasion of Ukraine was unprovoked and unjustified. Days before the invasion in February, Putin had offered several reasons for launching aggression, including the necessity to help prevent a genocide in non-government-controlled territories in Eastern Ukraine, Ukraine’s alleged desire to obtain nuclear weapons and Kyiv’s possible membership of NATO. These were only pretexts because Putin had seemingly taken the decision to invade Ukraine long before. In late 2021 and early 2022, Western nations were trying to conduct a constructive dialogue with Moscow on all disputed issues including security guarantees. Russia put forth excessive demands, so the West had to decline them. Russia opted for a policy of confrontation, which is why these discussions achieved no breakthrough. See our account of the Russian demands here and about Seven Popular Russian Myths here. See other examples of these disinformation narratives, such as claims that the result of the US 2020 election doesn’t matter because the real ruler is the Deep State, which will kill any US president that confronts it and is moving the country towards war with Iran and Russia; that Hillary Clinton published the Deep State strategy for the world; and that the Ukraine crisis was provoked by the West.",Real,The US will lead the world into extinction as elections change nothing

This false allegation goes in line with a wider pro-Kremlin disinformation campaign aiming to blame Western countries for a global food crisis engineered by Russia as part of its unjustified aggression against Ukraine.Russia's responsibility for the global food crisis comes as a consequence of the unprovoked and unjustified Russian invasion of Ukraine: naval blockade of Ukrainian posts, bombardment of transport infrastructure and shelling of farming regions. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has destabilised global food markets and is driving food prices up due to increased cost of production, transport and freight insurance. Russia has destroyed substantial food stocks, production, as well as processing and transport capacities in Ukraine.As can be seen from the database of the UN Black Sea Grain Initiative, as of 23 September, out of the 203 shipments, less then half, only 92 - headed to EU countries. The majority headed for other countries like Turkey, Egypt, China, and India. Besides, this doesn’t mean that these are their final destinations, as grain will be redistributed from some of these harbours to other countries.See also article 15. of the conclusions of the European Council of 20 and 21 October 2022 which states:Russia, by weaponising food in its war against Ukraine, is solely responsible for the global food security crisis it has provoked. Russia’s war of aggression has triggered disruptions of agricultural production, supply chains and trade that have driven world food and fertiliser prices to unprecedented levels.

They merged into a unified state - the Ukrainian People's Republic - on 22 January 1919. Under Lenin's leadership at the beginning of the 20th century, Ukraine was occupied by the Bolsheviks and for decades was under communist control.Under Lenin's leadership at the beginning of the 20th century, Ukraine was occupied by the Bolsheviks and for decades was under communist control.

This case is one more example of this. During the WWII, the alliance with Hitler was exactly the opposite: according to a secret additional protocol to the non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the USSR, concluded on August 23, 1939, the Stalin and Hitler regimes agreed to divide Europe among themselves. In September1939 both USSR and Germany invaded Poland starting WWII. Moreover, the initiative for this agreement came from Stalin. According to the memoirs by Vladimir Pavlov, who was Stalin’s personal translator at that meeting, German nazi foreign minister Ribbentrop brought only the text of the main treaty (on non-aggression), but Stalin said: “Additional agreements are needed for this treaty, about which we will not publish anything anywhere.” The text of the protocol was immediately drawn up, which was edited, printed and signed. Stalin stressed several times that this highly secret agreement should never be disclosed by anyone. Until today, most Russians ignore the existence of the pact. It was not made public The pact brought devastation to the states and regions that were carved up, resulted in the deportation and killing of thousands from those areas, and paved the way for the Soviet domination of Eastern Europe behind the Iron Curtain after the war's end in 1945.Throughout the war, most of the countries of Europe fought against Germany, and not together, as the disinformation narrative pretends. In addition to Italy and Germany, the European allies of the Axis countries were Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania (until 1944, when a coup took place in the country) and Finland (which waged a defensive war against the USSR since 1939). Slovakia and Croatia, which gained formal independence after the German attack on Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, respectively, were actually under German control (much like the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics today), so the ""voluntariness"" of their participation in the war is a big question. But the anti-Hitler coalition from European countries included Albania, Belgium, Great Britain, Greece, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, France, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.As for accusations of Ukrainians of wearing nazi symblos today, this is a fabrication from pro-Kremlin media. The myth of Nazi-ruled Ukraine has been the cornerstone of Russian disinformation about the country since the very beginning of the 2013-14 Euromaidan protests, when it was used to discredit the pro-European popular uprising in Kyiv and, subsequently, the broader pro-Western shift in Ukraine's foreign policy.In 2015 Ukraine issued a ban on Nazi and Communist ideologies.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has destabilised global food markets and is driving food prices up due to increased cost of production, transport and freight insurance. Russia has also destroyed substantial food stocks, production, as well as processing and transport capacities in Ukraine.The allegation that the US and the EU don’t care about starving Latin Americans is demonstrably false. EU sanctions do not include trade with Ukraine. As for trade with Russia, the sanctions do not include the import of agricultural products unless a sanctioned individual is involved. Moreover, the sanctions only cover bilateral trade between the EU and Russia, meaning that third countries can import Russian agrifood products without restriction.

The statement was made in the context of President Zelenskyy's special address to Lowy Institute. This is not the first time the Kremlin’s manipulation and disinformation machine has used a deep-seated and very reasonable fear of a nuclear disaster to advance its political and military goals in Ukraine.The claim that President Zelenskyy called for “preventive strikes” against Russia is incorrect and comes from a misinterpretation from a translated interview.On 24 February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. On February 27, 2022 Vladimir Putin ordered his military to put Russia’s nuclear deterrence forces on high alert. Before that, Putin had warned that ""whoever tries to hinder us"" in Ukraine would see consequences 'you have never seen in history'.Current Russian military strategy reserves the option to use nuclear weapons first. Russia's nuclear doctrine allows for a nuclear strike after ""aggression against the Russian Federation with conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is threatened"", if the state is at risk or possibly if Russia is losing a major war.From the first day of the war, Russia has been voicing its right to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine at all levels, from high-ranking officials to propagandists.Dmitry Medvedev, former Russian president, now deputy chair of the Russian security council said Moscow’s nuclear doctrine does not require the enemy state to use such weapons first. He threatens 'nuclear' move if NATO expands. In May, Medvedev warned about nuclear war over Western arms deliveries to Ukraine. In September Medvedev raises spectre of nuclear strike and says NATO would not get involved.In another notable example of warmongering and threats from Russia, EU-sanctioned Russian TV Host Dmitry Kiselyov lashed out at the UK, accusing it of pushing Ukraine to continue fighting against Russia and threatening the UK with nuclear annihilation.

Without providing evidence, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that top NATO officials had said that it’d be acceptable to carry out nuclear strikes on Russia. He threatened to use nuclear weapons adding that ""This Is Not a Bluff"".Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on NATO to conduct “preventative action” against Russia to prevent their use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

Crimea is an internationally recognised part of Ukraine. Іn 1997, by signing the Friendship Agreement with Ukraine, Russia also recognised that Crimea belongs to Ukraine.On the 1991 Crimea sovereignty referendum, voters were asked whether they wanted to re-establish the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. 94% of voters supported the proposal, and the Supreme Council of Ukrainian SSR established the autonomous Crimean Republic within the territory of Ukraine. After Ukraine adopted a new constitution in 1996, Crimea maintained its autonomy. Crimea has its own parliament and government.In 2014, Russian troops obliged the parliament of Crimea to organise a so-called referendum, which was illegitimate under international law, and then formally annexed the peninsula and brought it under Russian territorial control.No international body recognises the so-called referendum in 2014. The UN General Assembly adopted a resolution entitled “Territorial integrity of Ukraine”, stating that the referendum in Crimea was not valid and could not serve as a basis for any change in the status of the peninsula. On 17 December 2018, the UN General Assembly confirmed its non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea.Historical background: Crimea was annexed by Russian empire, then containing Ukraine, in 1783, already in violation of a treaty which guaranteed the independence of the Tatar khanate. In 1897, the first comprehensive census of the population of the empire indicates that the Russians are only one third of the inhabitants of Crimea, where they are still slightly fewer than the indigenous Crimean Tatars. The Russians only became a majority after the complete deportation in 1944 of the Tatars, who could only return after the fall of the communist regime. The annexation of Crimea to the then Soviet Ukraine, in 1954, was not done on a not ethnic, but geographical and economic basis, since the peninsula was adjoining and economically depending from the mainland areas, it means, Ukraine. At that, in 1937 Russian Soviet Socialist Republic received Taganrog from Ukrainian Socialist Republic. But Russia is not ready to ""give this gift back "" to Ukraine. There were several interchanges of territories between USSR's republics, which are all now sovereign States recognised by international law.Read also related cases: Russia has never violated the provisions of the Budapest Memorandum, Crimea rejoined Russia as a result of a popular referendum, Accusing Russia of annexing Crimea is ignoring its historical rights to the peninsula, Ukraine, USA and EU recognised the reunification of Crimea with Russia.",Real,Crimea is formally part of Russia

This narrative addresses the energy crisis in Europe amid the unprovoked Russian invasion of Ukraine, the subsequent Western counter measures towards Russia and the Kremlin’s retaliatory limiting of gas supplies. It plays well into the pro-Russian motif that the West is collapsing, a narrative which the Kremlin employs to exercise pressure and extort European governments, whilst creating public panic over energy insecurity and high costs.In early October 2022, the European Commission outlined possible strategies to cap gas prices as the EU awaits the imminent energy crisis this winter. European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen stated that an overall cap on the price of gas could be a temporary solution, only until a new European price index ensuring better market functioning is developed. She added that the Commission is already working on capping gas prices in order to help make sure European gas supplies are not compromised.Despite recent events, and in particular the attacks on the Nord Stream Pipelines, Europe is prepared to face this winter.

In fact, Russia has adopted many reckless actions regarding this facility, including placing military equipment and troops inside its premises, using its surroundings as a base for rocket and missile attacks, and interrupting its power line.

It was not an internal civil conflict but a well-documented act of aggression by Russian armed forces, ongoing since February 2014. The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine which has closely monitored the conflict has observed no such genocide.On the contrary, there is numerous evidence that Russia is committing war crimes in Ukraine, such as the shelling of shopping malls, killing civilians, raping, as well as using unprecise weapons.In the city of Izium, in the east of Ukraine, that was recently liberated, a mass grave with more than 440 bodies was discovered. It appears that some of them were Ukrainian soldiers who took part in defending the city in March. Izium was under occupation since 1 April 2022. Numerous Ukrainian and foreign investigative organisations try to establish the reason of the deaths in each case.Preliminary results, according to Ukrainian police, show that some people were victims of a Russian airstrike on an apartment block in March, in which 47 people were killed.

The Ukrainian Army and volunteers are fighting with Russian troops to defend their country from unprovoked Russian military aggression. Russian President Putin launched a new, full-scale invasion, what he called a ""special military operation"" against Ukraine on 24 February 2022 citing NATO’s military infrastructure approaching the Russian border as a pretext. Another pretext for the so-called operation is the “demilitarisation and denazification” of Ukraine according to official Russian statements. The invasion was followed by airstrikes on military objects. Russian troops soon after started bombing and shelling civilian targets as well.The referendums are shams, conducted in haste and under military repressionand as far from the ""public will of the people"" as imaginable. Ukraine is a well-defined nation-state with a long history and its own literature and identity, despite foreign rule for long periods of time. Ukrainians and Russians belong to the Slavs ethnolinguistic group but they are not a single nation. The ""all-Russian big nation"" is an imperial Russian and Russian revanchist ideology that is a favoured pro-Kremlin narrative aimed at weakening the national identity of Ukrainians, as well as undermining the state sovereignty.See similar disinformation narratives in our database: Russians, Belarusians and Ukrainians are a single nation; Ukraine became a colony of the United States; Ukraine is a Western puppet that creates problems for Russia; Anglo-Saxons are on the edge of an anti-Russian attack.Read our recent referenda-related analysis ""Mad rush for illegitimate hold on occupied territories"" and along with EU vs Disinfo's Guide to Deciphering Pro-Kremlin disinformation around Putin's War.",Real,"The referendums in Ukraine is the beginning, Russia has to get Kyiv back"

OSCE condemned the sentencing of OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM) mission members Maxim Petrov and Dmytro Shabanov as a result of so-called “legal proceedings” and called for the immediate release of all three OSCE mission members in detention.The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM) was deployed on 21 March 2014, following a request to the OSCE by Ukraine’s government and a consensus decision by all 57 OSCE participating States. The SMM was an unarmed, civilian mission, present on the ground 24/7 in all regions of Ukraine. Since its deployment in March 2014, the Mission issued 2432 daily reports and 242 spot reports. SMM officials issued reports on a daily basis about the current situation in the war zone. One of the SMM’s main tasks was to observe and report in an impartial and objective way on the situation in Ukraine, and to facilitate dialogue among all parties to the crisis.The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission mandate expired on 31 March 2022.

The results of such actions will be null and void and would not be recognised by the EU and its Member States. The intention to annex territories occupied by force since February 2022 and to hold sham referenda will not change their legal status. They are and they will remain internationally recognised as an integral part of Ukraine.US President Joe Biden described the referendums as ""a sham"", saying they were a ""false pretext"" to try to annex parts of Ukraine by force in violation of international law.The disinformation claim is connected also with an earlier statement the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made on 5 August 2021. Speaking in a TV interview, the Ukrainian President said that the occupied territories of eastern Ukraine will never be Russian, and he encouraged residents there who consider themselves Russian and would want the region to become part of the Russian Federation to go and seek a place in Russia. However, in a large contradiction to the claim, Zelenskyy never said anything about relocating ethnic Russian people from the Donbas region, while the Ukrainian government has never shown any intention of that, either.One of the Kremlin’s most common disinformation narratives to justify its devastating war against Ukraine and illegal referenda is the lie that Russia is pursuing the “denazification” of Ukraine, a claim already widely debunked, including by EUvsDisinfo.

Ukraine assesses Russia’s losses at more than 56,000. Independent data are somewhat lower, but they are in any case much higher than Russia’s. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has said 300,000 people will be called up in the partial mobilisation, which is 1 per cent of the overall number of Russians who could be called up for military service. Putin’s decree contains a secret paragraph on the number of conscripts, so there is no exact information about how many people are to be drafted and whether this mobilisation is really partial or total. Moscow needs new conscripts in order to replenish its human resources and continue its unjustified aggression against Ukraine, not to protect its sovereignty and its security or liberate the people of Donbas from purported ""Ukrainian Nazis"".

The recent recapture of the Ukrainian territories is by far the Ukrainian military's biggest achievement, since they pushed the Russian troops back from the capital Kyiv in March.The latter counter-offensive maneuvers have not only pushed Russian troops out of the Kharkiv region but are now also threatening to retake territories Putin's troops seized in the Donbas — the eastern industrial heartland whose ""freedom"" the Kremlin has pinpointed as the main goal of the ""special military operation"". If Russia starts losing key territories that they have recently gained in the Donbas region, it would be virtually impossible to hide Kremlin’s ensuing military and political failure.Regarding the fact that Putin just recently made nuclear threats and initiated a partial mobilisation, the latter can be viewed as a clear indicator that the war is not going according to his plan.

The devastating blow to Ukraine's economy -- not speaking of huge human toll due to the Russian aggressive war -- does not however back the recurring disinformation claim about a ""puppet-like statehood"". On the contrary, in the face of large-scale aggression the Ukrainian people has demonstrated a resolute will to defend Ukrainian statehood. Available sociological surveys show high levels of Zelenskyy’s public approval. IRI Ukraine poll of late June 2022 showed that 91% of Ukrainians approve of Zelenskyy’s performance. The poll also found strong confidence in victory over Russia, little desire for territorial concessions, and a spike for NATO membership.The claim about Ukraine's financing support is intended to question the viability of Ukrainian statehood. Pro-Kremlin media outlets often cast doubts on Ukrainian statehood and claim that Ukraine either does not exist as a state or is going to tumble down very soon. In reality, present-day Ukraine has been on the world map since 1991 when the Soviet Union disintegrated. It has elected six presidents since then and changed parties in government several times which illustrates political diversity and democratic dynamics even during economic hardship in the wake of Russian aggression in 2014.One of the Kremlin’s most common disinformation narratives to justify its devastating war against Ukraine is the lie that Russia is pursuing the “denazification” of Ukraine.

22.08.2022,t.me,"The claim is a deliberate distortion of the original interview granted by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to The Washington Post and published on 16 August 2022. The goal of this narrative is to try to discredit Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a frequent target of pro-Kremlin disinformation, by portraying him as a selfish leader who doesn’t care about the Ukrainian people.Zelenskyy never uses the words “offensive” or “military operation”, euphemisms used by pro-Kremlin media to refer to the unjustified Russian aggression against Ukraine. Moreover, Zelenskyy doesn’t say that he chose not to warn the population in order to save his own government, but that creating panic among the Ukrainian population would have been self-defeating and may have destroyed Ukraine’s economy, especially given that Ukrainian authorities believed that the invasion may ultimately not take place.In the interview, as well as in an accompanying long article about the run-up to the aggression, Zelenskyy and other members of his cabinet explained that US intelligence about the upcoming attack was considered vague and inconclusive “until four or five days before the invasion began”, namely until the Munich Security Conference on 18-20 February, when Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba received specific information about Russia’s attack plans.This second article includes long explanations about why Ukrainian authorities chose this path:“We had to strike a balance between realistically assessing the risks and preparing the country for the worst … and keeping the country running economically and financially,” Kuleba said. “Every comment coming from the United States about the unavoidability of war was immediately reflected in the [Ukrainian] currency exchange rate.”And:“We took all of the information that our Western partners were giving us seriously,” recalled [Andriy] Yermak, Zelensky’s chief of staff. “But let’s be honest: Imagine if all of this panic that so many people were pushing had taken place. Creating panic is a method of the Russians. … Imagine if this panic had started three or four months beforehand. What would’ve happened to the economy? Would we have been able to hold on for five months like we have?”.In the interview, Zelenskyy’s exact words are:“You can’t simply say to me, “Listen, you should start to prepare people now and tell them they need to put away money, they need to store up food.” If we had communicated that — and that is what some people wanted, who I will not name — then I would have been losing $7 billion a month since last October, and at the moment when the Russians did attack, they would have taken us in three days. I’m not saying whose idea it was, but generally, our inner sense was right: If we sow chaos among people before the invasion, the Russians will devour us. Because during chaos, people flee the country. And that’s what happened when the invasion started — we were as strong as we could be. Some of our people left, but most of them stayed here, they fought for their homes. And as cynical as it may sound, those are the people who stopped everything. If that were to happen, in October — God forbid, during the heating season — there would be nothing left. Our government wouldn’t exist, that’s 100 percent sure.”Although this argument can be controversial, it is certainly very different than “confessing that he didn’t warn the Ukrainian population to save his own government”. Seen in context, it is very clear that the words of Volodymyr Zelenskyy refer to the government Ukrainians chose to put in power through democratic elections instead of the puppet administration that Russia intended to install after the invasion, not to Zelenskyy’s own political faction, as this disinformation story disingenuously affirms.See other examples of similar disinformation narratives in our database, such as claims that Zelenskyy gets military advice from his 9-year old son, that decisions on Ukraine are not made by Zelenskyy but by the high-ranking officials in the US, that Zelenskyy wants to cede Ukrainian territory to Poland, or that Zelenskyy is only a marketing operation, a Jewish face for a Nazi regime.",Real,Zelenskyy didn’t warn Ukrainians about Russia’s offensive to save his own government

The alliance only wants to ensure the security of its member states. NATO is primarily a political organisation, which aims at solving conflicts by peaceful means. Finland’s and Sweden’s future membership of the alliance is caused by their desire to protect themselves from possible threats and challenges in the future rather than by NATO’s alleged intention to inflict harm on Russia.Since Russia re-started its unjustified aggression against Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the West has been calling for a peaceful settlement. Due to Russia’s refusal to seriously discuss a diplomatic solution and its resolve to continue fighting and targeting civilian objects, Western nations took a tougher stand and imposed sanctions on Moscow and certain Russian individuals. These measures are not to be considered threatening or aggressive because they only aim to stop fighting rather than to infringe harm on the vital interests of Russians.It is true that some NATO member states are providing military assistance to Ukraine in repelling Russia’s unprovoked war of aggression. This aid is of defensive character. Ukraine is using these weapons to fight the Russian invasion. It does not intend to move forward into Russian territory after defeating the Russian aggression.
